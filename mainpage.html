        <I>A final project for fall 2025 semester, CUNY MS Data Visualization Program, prompted by key 
            themes in Critical AI Studies and Data Bias Classes. - Erin Livingston (they/them)</I>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This digital projct is a collection of my personal sources, an interrogation of my outputs using the abilities
            of scale and pattern recognition of AI. Here I create a portrait of my inquiry from 'primary sources'
            of my self. This work offers an alternative to the homogeny of contemporary big-box ai models, it offers a deep consideration of senses, 
            desires for information, and the limits of application without materiality.

        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>
            My goal is to consider how one's identity through inquiry could layer with knowledge through <i>senses</i> 
            and material experiences. Could non-text knowledge live in a model? How could I design values-forward? Could I layer a digital
            system with sources from me? 
            Create an AI 'cyborg' that encourages my curiosity, and values ways of knowing the world around me. 
        </p>
        <p> [In the fatigue of a world where we're constantly consuming - and the critical literature doomy stuff I read this semester
             I want to resist and be the one to feed and to build, to restructure and re-layer the tools around me, imbue them with values they 
             clearly weren't built with.] I desire disclsoure, combined with curiosity in the ways we use AI. This project serves as that, and a deep 
            reflection of the ways I search for, and process, knowledge in myself and others.

            This project is composed of three parts.

        <h2>Dialogic Inquiry</h2>
        <p> How do we understand ourselves through our interactions with AI? What do my prompts
            reval of me? Even more interesting to me, how can I wield the answers
            to create betters versions digital infrasturctures in AI. (and my horizontal digital infrastucture?)
