        <I style="color:#14a127">A final project for fall 2025 semester, CUNY MS Data Visualization Program, prompted by key 
            themes in Critical AI Studies and Data Bias Classes. - Erin Livingston (they/them)</I>

        <p>This digital projct is a collection of my personal sources, an interrogation of my outputs using the abilities
            of scale and pattern recognition of AI. Here I create an RAG model that is fed modes of my inquiry. These are txt files 
            and artwork that represent 'primary sources'of my self. This work offers an alternative to the homogeny of contemporary big-box ai models, 
            it offers a deep consideration of senses, 
            desires for information, and the limits of application without materiality.

        <h2>Construction of this Conceptual Model</h2>
        <p>
            My goal is to consider how one's identity through inquiry could layer with knowledge through <i>senses</i> 
            and material experiences. Could non-text knowledge live in a model? How could I design values-forward? Could I layer a digital
            system with sources from me? 
            Create an AI 'cyborg' that encourages my curiosity, and values ways of knowing the world around me. 
        </p>
        <p> In the fatigue of a world where we're constantly consuming I want to resist and be the one to feed and to build, to restructure and re-layer the tools around me, 
            imbue them with values they clearly weren't built with. I desire disclsoure, combined with curiosity in the ways we use AI. This project serves as that, and a deep 
            reflection of the ways I search for, and process, knowledge in myself and others.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project is composed of three parts.

        <h2>Dialogic Inquiry</h2>
        <p> How do we understand ourselves through our interactions with AI? What do my prompts
            reval of me? Even more interesting to me, how can I wield the answers
            to create betters versions digital infrasturctures in AI. (and my horizontal digital infrastucture?)
