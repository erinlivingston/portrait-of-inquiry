Data Conscience, Dr. Brandeis Marshall

Ch 1 – Oppression By

Immediacy, outcomes overshadowing people, situations are beyond the scope of the quantitative, need to face qualitative perspectives too

Anti-Blackness + White Colonialism a global phenomenon

Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome, Dr. Joy DeGruy, humanity severed from Black people before the slave trade, compounding Black trauma

Algorithmic colonialism

Historic black colleges and universities (HBCUs) founded and designed for Black students, coined in 1965, many founded in 1867

federal government granted land over to 15 HBCUs, a handful of Black men elected to office

Black Codes

Mississippi and South Carolina he first to pen Black codes, contracts/laws around work and employment that allowed white people full power and manipulation of terms, no protections for Black people

The Rise of Jim Crow Laws, “separate but equal” a blatant instance of cluster analysis

“It doesn’t take a bunch of words to say the truth, but it takes a lot of words to misdirect, misinform, and share false equivalencies”

Black women’s work life regulations (demands of care by white people!) > height of the Spanish flu pandemic 1918

Black women mandated to work

1954 Brown vs. Board of Ed first crack in separate but equal, only for Black children

Overt Surveillance

1934 Federal Communications Act, wiretapping acceptable and pro-democracy, organization surveillance on MLK, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton

‘threat to national security’ subjective

Surveillance at Scale, facial recognition, traffic cameras, retail stores, DMV, ring cameras

The Science & Numbers are rooted in white European culture, binary number systems rooted in Egyptian origins, later in China where credited founder, Leibniz took inspiration

Assignment of numbers to people, permanent in tech systems

Numbers at their core are abstractions of the physical world

Anthropometry – scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body

1870s French police officer used physical observations to catalog suspected/confirmed criminals > Bertillon card system

Used to fuel recidivism laws first enacted in France

Eugenics

Pseudoscience of selective breeding, improvement of humanity, wants science to prove White people are superior to Black people

Combined with anthropometry to characterize physical characteristics as criminal in the US, thrived due to ‘interesting theories’ and consistent funding

Rockefeller & Carnegie Institute

Fingerprinting replaced anthropometry categories, cataloging people in prison systems

Measurements taken at Tuskegee Institute, historically Black college

Coerced and forced sterilization at many times in the US, Brown immigrant populations were/are targets

Ch 2 – Morality

Convenient truth we tell ourselves, we can’t control what others do with data and what tech is produced

Intricate interdependency of data, can bring enormous benefits

Data is perceived as useful, which makes it valuable, it exists in every nook and cranny of digital and physical spaces

Data generates data, a data overload each day

Co-option by white society (of BlackTwitter hashtags) through retooling, reimagining, and reconfiguring content and messaging revisionism

Contemporary moment, fourth industrial revolution and the knowledge economy

Human ethics > physical world, Tech ethics > digital replica of our physical worlds, Data ethics > distinctions between information/misinformation

Over-respect, over grace extended to computing professionals, focus on their work products instead of human impacts

Lone wolf alpha persona in computer science

Curriculums have little to no inclusion of ethics, emphasize ways to handle intrusions in digital spaces, detection and protection

Challenging of building tech with a moral compass, as we have no societal consensus of human morality

People making decisions falls into seven guiding principles:

Choice, conscience, fairness, honesty, honor, integrity, and value

Fairness and value are effects discovered as part of long-term impact

Tech is propped up as the solution to human error, but we’ve hit a reality of technical errors

To be truly ‘transparent’ means generating more data

Challenge on preserving digital rights, intellectual property for corporations (stands in the way of transparency)

Transaction where user gives more than it gets

Notion of fairness cannot be diagnosed, cannot create a universal standard

Privacy almost a false choice in the knowledge economy, Data privacy is about managing access to systems

We cannot roll back tech harms on the backend, as tech only evolves forward, can create ‘makeshift hacks’

Misconceptions:

Goodness of Data, Tech by proxy is apolitical or bipartisan

PULSE, AI model that can create photos of faces from a pixelated photo

Data ethics is only focused on laws and protecting confidentiality

Model cards, help quantitative researchers visualize boundaries around a model’s capabilities and limitations

Implementing data practices will make data objective

Ethics & Diversity are interchangeable with equity and inclusion (DEI)

Software developers are only responsible for societal outcomes stemming from their code

Ch 3 – Bias

Black people in keyword searches with gorillas appearing, Black hairstyles tagged as unprofessional

Tech avoids contending with influence on people until its forced, tech has taken on a persona of rebranding computer science

Ethics is not instilled in comp sci curriculum guidelines

Bias takes on the two extremes of:

Combatting prejudice

Correcting-mathematically based errors

Both sides are talking past one another

Harpreet Sahota, “The Artists of Data Science” podcast, confirmation bias, disconfirmation bias, overconfidence, availability, recency, illusion of control

Software development life cycle (SDLC), requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, review, maintenance

Never ending cycle of plan-do-revise for tech innovation

Each access point is an opportunity for software faults and biases to grow

Systemic discrimination and inequities are folded into the process, alongside trying to rectify mathematically based errors originated by its creators

Algorithm – a well-ordered collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations that produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time

The Bias Wheel, every rotation distributes impact

Business bias, algorithmic bias, human bias, data bias

Data toggles between three states

Data sourcing, CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity, availability, computer security as a wrapper with its own set of processes

Data Manipulation, quality and privacy: intellectual property concerns and personal data privacy

Data Interpretation, trustworthiness, usability, auditing

Cannot automate trustworthiness

The way we translate outcomes coming from machine instructions can propel or stifle acceptance of ideas in society

Ch 4 – Computational Thinking in Practice

Algorithms, only computable operations considered algorithms, noncomputational measures cannot be captured

Computers need all steps of the ‘how to’ not just ‘what’ (shampoo example)

Computational thinking

What should people be doing rather than allowing computers to do the work?

Which tasks should computers do rather than people because people make more mistakes than computers?

We cannot work on computation in isolation from humanity, although it’s the current norm, need to factor in reciprocal relationship between computing and people

Lines of code include the preferences/personality of developers

Coding Environments

Storage types, data types, formats, data architectures, enterprise systems

IDEs, computing services, and data platforms are not created the same

Myspace data loss, 12 years of customer data 2003 – 2015

Code cloning, an array of open-source coding libraries (designed by white males)

Erin – Marshall goes into a granular analysis of text parsing python code found in Github as it related to resume selection, review, and incorporated bias. Hard to understand these sections with code language

Ch 5 – Messy Gathering Grove

Data collection and reformat, tech takes people out of automated decision-making processes

Asking why! ‘We need this information to make tech better’ an inadequate answer

Cookie selection, fast decisions and tech builders reliant on us overwhelmed or in a rush to accept without hesitation

Data collection and sourcing process as equitable needs to include equitable approach to reformatting and translation procedures

What’s morally right, and what’s legal are not the same!

Intensity of data protection isn’t transitive, third-party vendors hire other third-party vendors, lineage issues cascade

National ethics committee, Institutional Review Board (IRB)

Combine protocols with IRB oversight and establish relationships with expert equity-first organizations (Black in AI, Data for Black Lives, SACNAS)

Data ownership and privacy, digital consumers provide data freely and assume non-ownership

Gather data or repurpose existing data and make assumptions about usefulness

Feeling of being overexposed > countermeasure of privacy provisions

Asking these questions can make you a pariah on the team, obstructionist to progress

Pinpoint vulnerable data features, note impactful limitations of generating our own data

Don’t take on the complete burden to re-educate others in data education, it keeps others from learning about their impact of data in tech

Data formatting synonymous with garbage collector/sanitation; no one wants to do it!

Ch 6 – Inconsistent Storage Sanctuary

Database administrators (DBAs) have knowledge of database architecture and design, sets digital foundation for all content

Asking the ‘what’ questions, action plan, often confrontational

Content managers, acting as content creators, preparing data for machine readability and usability, human senses are deafened for machines to be comfortable

Data manipulation questions

Does the data fit into the digital infrastructure?

Is the data complete in the infrastructure?

Is the data correct in the infrastructure?

Cloud storage the prevailing database infrastructure, issues revolve around security, internet connectivity, data control and governance, cost managements, lack of data practitioner expertise

Decisions around storage reverberate through the entire life cycle

Appear to be abstract discussion: data stewardship, administration, database admin

Chief data officer, in charge of all things data

Building templates, standard operating procedures, rigid structures to accomplish goals, detail-oriented rules

Sub-field of “Big Data” emerged, 3D data management, volume, velocity, variety

Creative Commons license levels

Grouping people in databases, is a baseline discriminatory practice, oversimplification of people's identities

Relational database management rely on one-to-many and one-to-one relationships, introducing more tables can hit a ceiling in what context can be maintained

Datasheets for database configuration: Motivation, composition, collection process, preprocessing, distribution, maintenance, ethical and legal considerations

Structured Query Language (SQL), at every stage and request is filtering, systematic removal, datasheets for these queries

Ch 7 – Circus of Misguided Analysis

Automated decision systems and AI, increasing quantity not quality

Data analysis a showcase of manicured data wrapped in tech product’s clothing

Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, machine learning, statistical modeling, data mining, predictive analytics, natural language processing, deep learning

“How” we do data analysis in a constant state of disarray, constant troubleshooting

Tech industry tracks and amplifies favorable outcomes, downplaying those that reveal fragility, and analysts fall into traps of over fitting into limited paradigms

Time spent addressing how questions is propped up as the nemesis of budget

Data and software teams have preferred ‘tech stacks’, performing routine audits akin to code review, important to stay up to date on open-source libraries

Outcomes vs results, outcomes indicate observation vs results as correctness

Upper and lower bounds used as proxies, top-k, predefine K, assumption this equates to relevancy

Automated decisions reducing humanness, brown color palette categorization in background special effects, washing away a person

Blurred lines between comparing elements in similar and dissimilar ways, flexibility in outcomes allows algorithmic harm

Tech should have prevented the moratorium surrounding deepfake technologies

Deepfakes, full or partial replacement of a person’s physical characteristics with another

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) transform real content, manipulate correct data into fake data, and intentionally suppress indicators the data is falsified

Open datasets with faces to be extracted, altered portions of real humans

Audio generation, talking head models to mimic loved ones

FaceIt computer program, preparation, execution, production

Generative model sometimes referred to as a ‘counterfeiter’

MyHeritage, online genealogy company, Api-styled access to animate family members

Face filters, beauty isolation of all features on the face for these applications, available algorithms for reuse in other tech

Early studies and efforts for fairness lack luster, focused on modeling the real world (no good examples there!) contemporary maneuvers seek forgiveness instead of permission

Code dependencies are deep and widespread, untangling nearly impossible without full redesign

Let go of the belief that analysis can solve all the social ills of discrimination, suppression, and oppression

True equitable representation and participation from minoritized communities is a small progressive step

Ch 8 – Double-Edged Visualization Sword

Remixing information opens the door to discovery and misinformation/disinformation

In building and consuming visualization, we make leaps about it as a trusted output

Visuals aren’t designed to tell a whole story, snapshots

Early research papers, cited often, note visuals are processed exponentially faster; this notion is debunked by Dr. Marshall, misinformation!

Visuals as a deflection piece to present as though progress has been made

‘Public needs small-dose relatable situations that demonstrate potential harms, evidence that organizations tried to reduce bad consequences’ > builds trust

When questions, before/after conditions to arrive at the finish

Need an inventory of harm-inducing algorithms, and an algorithmic audit of these processes

Don’t be a data hypocrite

Critiquing

“Strength comes in multiple people from different departments at different leadership levels, repeating similar concerns from various business operations perspectives”

Rigor becomes how people are guided (through visualizations) to a multitude of outcomes displayed, visuals are reigning supreme in marketing and digital content

Promotion of products and services in all business sectors

Push for meta world, web 3

Society reaction to tech is defensive, reactionary

Visualizations hide people’s dataphobia, and visual content ostracizes people with disabilities

Ingestion of audio-visual content is a privilege, designed for hearing and seeing people

Pictures of text, writing alt text often buried within the posting workflow, sloppy on the tech industry’s part!

Paying separate vendors to achieve accessibility

Conditions for worthwhile visuals, memorability and insightfulness, ‘going a step further than pretty,’ synthesis description, understanding and communication

Seeing theory, brown university visuals designed with d3

Ch 9 – By the Law

Tech moves fast, law moves slow, plight for tech responsibility is at the very beginning stage

European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California consumer privacy act (CCPA)

Algorithmic Accountability Act 2019, and 2022, collected dust in between, not enough tech-specific direction

Federal Trade Commission facilitates oversight and enforcement, specifies ‘critical decision,’ applications affecting consumers’ lives, companies will have a difficult time side-stepping this

Annual impact assessment, establishment of Bureau of Technology but insufficient funds and professionals, need a budget commensurate to the IRS

State level policies center data privacy, very few states, us legislation in infancy, estimated 2-3 generations for all states to have data privacy legislature

What one country does inform others on digital infrastructure, private investment dollars go toward reducing computational time

Biggest international regulation in 2022 out of the EU, Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, trying to create safer online platforms > gatekeeper organizations to prevent monopolies

Regulation highlights how AI has been primed to absorb society’s value systems and reflect them back to us

Trust, fairer practices, and data privacy represent the bulk of legal framework to regulate tech companies

More comprehensive regulation needs to encompass pressure on more than the data and ai tools, industries listed: arts, education, agriculture, finance, education, tech, professional services, hospitality, waste management

Tech has created a problem, amplified it, and provides mitigating interventions (mobile phone addiction > apps to control addiction)

Recommendation by Dr. Marshall to create a data equity-focused agency, mirrored after the CDC, Center for Technological Civility (CTC)

Designing technology to monitor technology is problematic, validation requires human approval, machines cannot monitor other machines

Companies cannot use person/entity status for tax season and then circumvent malfeasance

Prosecute for malcoding, digitized harm inducing ideas/outcomes through algorithms, reconfigure codebases, deprecation of malcode

Prosecute data brokers, regulate brokers who compromise people and sensitive data

Algorithmic destruction, FTC implementation, data collected illegally and used in algorithms should be destroyed (both data and algorithm)

Taking companies' money doesn’t change behavior, destroying their sources of said money can be an integral tool

Develop Algorithmic Destroyer infrastructure and positions

Create a legal framework for tech probationary jail, short-term banning and long-term tech incarceration for algorithms, processes, and tools

Create a legal framework for a company to experience probationary jail, short-term banning, and or long-term incarceration

Probationary jail, computing networks slowed down,

Short-term ban, slowed network and during 2 peak business hours, two or three times a week, company experiences a halt in delivering products and services

Long term, company presence suspended in hours to day segments over multiple months, digital infrastructure inaccessible during this blackout period

Ch 10 – By Algorithmic Influencers

Narrative of efficiency in tech blinds us to harms absorbed by minoritized communities

Algorithmic influencers, concept to encapsulate people who peddle AI as the solution to economic, political, and social issues

Focus on use case of produces that extrapolate usefulness to other cases

Evgeny Morozov, technological solutionism, intentional unknown costs of these solutions

Perceived problems become difficult to solve because they’re broken down into smaller parts

Falls into a pattern of attempting to separate ‘good’ from the ‘bad’ based on pre-existing assumptions

Rocchio algorithm, designed for filtering, assessing and retrieving documents related to a word or phrase (1971), outcome based on where we start and what we perceive as relevant minus what we perceive as not relevant

Companies creating and releasing tech calculate (predict) the amount and duration of backlash from the public, and deploy anyway

False narrative that the tech workforce hasn’t reached demographic parity for Black people, ‘not enough Black talent’

April Christina Curley, former HBCU diversity specialist at Google, entrenched discrimination against intern and employee candidates from HBCUs

False narration of the Black tech pipeline problem allows tech companies to stay in control, despite announced initiatives and partnerships, no quota improvements on Black people in positions at these companies

Is tech solutionism driving the project steps and phases, rather than the issue in need of remedy?

Much of national and international attention focuses on how white privilege harms non-white people, ignoring how it uplifts white people

Life isn’t fair a common colloquialism, we have yet to experience fairness in the physical world, nothing to model the digital world after

Fairness:

Treating similar individuals similarly: on its face, unachievable and it dehumanizing to assume like attributes will have the same outcome

Never favor a worse individual over a better one: meritocracy as our society operationalize is another relabeling of white supremacist thought

Calibrated fairness: fairness is a distribution based on merit (W.E.B. Du Bois, The Talented Tenth, stipulating a ceiling on Black success)

Binary yes/no framing, no room for investigation of disparate acts of a person or situation, having satisfied multiple criteria simultaneously

Broadening fairness, fairness is contextual, “Model Cards for Model Reporting” Google Ethical AI researchers in 2018

Demonstrations to record model’s input/output, architecture, performance eval, trade-offs, limitations, executive summary with code/visualizations/narrative

Google-Microsoft, Responsible AI Licenses, multi-institution SECure framework, PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Responsible AI Toolkit

Explainable AI, $3.5 billion industry (as of 2020)

Content moderation, specific to companies and at the whim of their protocols or flagging algorithms,

Need to drastically increase moderator workforces and support them accordingly with in-house jobs and benefits!

Twitter profile bans for sarcastic comments from Black women, vs keeping up racist widely viewed content from white male platforms

Enforcement remains confusing

Being a black woman on and offline, one of two extremes, either no one listens to you, or words are fodder for scrutiny, surveillance, and judgement

Moya Bailey, The Abuse and Misogynoir Playbook, disbelieving, devaluing, and discrediting contributions of black women as the historical norm

Current practices in content moderation embrace this and deploy it algorithmically

Public Value Failure framework, nine categories describing society’s failure providing public values

Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, formed by founding members of tech titan companies, focus on safety terrorism has a nationalist, homogenous nature – no callouts to race or gender, class, ableism

Digital power creates tech capital more effective and impactful than social capital

Ch 11 – By the Public

If history is our teacher, the lesson is that fighting for humanity and dignity in digital spaces will take over 100 years, Jim Crow 2.0 a modernization of Jim Crow laws for the digital space

Ruha Benjamin, Simone Browne, Meredith Broussard, Jesse Daniels, Virginia Eubanks, Safiya Noble, impacts of racism, sexism, otherism through algorithmic practices

Chronicle algorithmic assaults, data literacy for the public with an intentional focus on data impact and causes important to the voting populace

Data Civics, public-facing data activities and operations, practice organizing and disseminating data understandings to the public to inform and enrich their lives

Stage 1, people’s relationship to data

Stage 2, Data’s relationship with equity

Stage 3, Data’s relationship to machines

The state of the data industry, poor percentage breakdown of white people vs. Black, Asian, Latino

Goal of equity, in tech circles this is often synonymous with affirmative action or forced equality, subsequent conversations veer to white friendly terms, diversity and inclusion

Be present and consistent but not famous, proactively avoid direct communication, use alternative language and spellings, stop engaging with rude profiles and orgs

Give hate zero oxygen to propagate in digital systems

Condemning the original stain, enslaved African people were considered non-persons, assets, liabilities

Kim Crayton, profit without oppression’s guiding principles

Tech is not neutral or apolitical, intention without strategy is chaos, lack of inclusion is a risk/crisis management issue, prioritize the most vulnerable

The Condemnation of Blackness, Khalil Gibran Muhammad

Preface & Introduction

Loophole in the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery except as punishment for crime

crime statistics became a way of communicating inferiority and pathologies of black people ‘technology of social difference’

Black populations under criminal justice supervision exceed some whole countries and communities in Africa

Collective guilt of Black people remains core logic to drive policy debates

Frederick Hoffman, NJ demographer, used crime data to support black inferiority, personal responsibility to blame for disparities, black traits

Blue ribbon commissions on racialized policing occur repeatedly, collection and dissemination of racial crime a eugenics project

Felony disenfranchisement spread state by state

Manipulation of crime and education data to deduce Black people with higher education turned into criminals, underlying these studies an ugly assumption: are Black people criminals and uneducated?

White Crime in the progressive era saw researchers call for less policing

Avoided language of personal responsibility, described great army of unfortunates, ‘driven to madness, crime or suicide’

Violence as symptoms of class oppression, built exit-ramps out of poverty

Liberals helped immigrants and poor whites by building new socioeconomic structures

Social statistical survey as modern fraud, Albert Murray, group in power will always use all means to stay in power

CompStat NYPD Crime Mappin software, algorithmic

Introduction: The Mismeasure of Crime

Statistical measure of black criminality is the glue that binds race to crime

Why did criminality outpace other ideas or proofs of black inferiority? Ideological currency

1928 Thorsten Sellin, white sociologist publishes about Black stigma in criminality/policing

1890 census included prison statistics for the first time, joined basis of discussion around Black criminality

This became a unifier for Americans, a widely accepted bases for justifying prejudicial thinking

Statistical discourse that violence erupted in Black communities in Northern White cities (late 1960s)

Gradual adoption of anti-black racism important for immigrant assimilation

Invidious Black Migration narrative framed by crime statistics during urbanization in Progressive era, ‘danger of the Black newcomer’

Meanwhile, statistics and sociology used to create a pathway for redemption and rehabilitation of white criminals

Color-blind universalism additional thread of contempt

“I am not racist; numbers speak for themselves” “Playing the race card” in infancy during this time

Progressive era the founding moment for discourse of black dysfunctionality (1890’s - 1920’s) ‘ghetto ethnography’

Racist notions of biological inferiority gave way to notions of cultural inferiority

Conservative Black elites echoed class bias and victim blaming when speaking of poor Black communities

White social workers/progressives failed to invest in these communities wanting them to save themselves, Black progressives fought back

Widespread race riots and mob violence in northern cities during Great Migration years

Antiliberal sentiment that northern Blacks were their ‘own worst enemy’ because immigrants were able to ‘escape’ slums in poverty

Liberalism fueled immigrant success even as racial liberalism foundered on the shoals of black criminality

Affirmative Action was all White

Ch 1 – Saving the Nation: The Racial Data Revolution and the Negro Problem

Regional instabilities between the North and South within scientific and popular discourses on the nature and meaning of Blackness

Nathaniel Shaler, Harvard Scientist, published several papers scientific racism, though considered a racial liberal

Postbellum census reports ushered in racial data revolution

Settlement and incorporation of African Americans drove white people to pathologize Blackness, seeds of dread planted by White post-emancipation writers

‘Experiment in freeing blacks results in more harm’, Haiti and Jamaica used as examples, ‘barbaric,’ animal in nature, incapable of controlling sexual impulses or work together > don’t let ‘charming nature or quick sensibilities’ fool you

Leading race scientists: Louis Aggasiz, G. Stanley Hall, Charles Darwin

Shaler was one of the first naturalists/race-relation experts to call for use of social science methods and social statistics to measure behavior

Post-emancipation inquiries: what quality of citizenship, of coexistence, what grade of humankind do Black people deserve?

Scale of mass freedom created this ‘intellectual challenge’

“Blacks would have to rise and fall on their own without the benefits of slavery”

Slavery problem became the Negro problem, these people/their blood has an evil past,

Erin – the evil White people were pathologizing of Black people at large was that they created in their own infrastructures and cast down on that of vulnerable communities. Data is currency here.

Black criminality, disease, lack of intelligence, 1890s – 1940s criminality as the most cited justifications for inequality and mortality

Social sciences helped writers avoid accusations of regional/sectional bias, Erin- ‘data’ as a cover for bias here

Naturalist Scientists

Searched for physical holy grail that proved Black deficiency, stupid ‘science,’ when they couldn’t find physical proof, they assumed mental deficiency unseen.

Polygenesis- early nineteenth century theory that God has made Blacks as separate and distinct species of Humans beneath Whites

Anglo-Saxon civilizations discourse, global and Eurocentric spin on white supremacy, White Americans of English or German descent are natural born leaders of America

Behaviorist Paradigm – measuring inferiority using historical ‘primitive behavior’ of other races in civilized societies

Fossil Fuel extraction > Rise of the wage laborer, demands for elites to explain their success, ‘survival of the fittest’ used to reinforced inequality, a subsumed understanding these groups are dominated because of their own weaknesses

Anglo-Saxonism indistinguishable from white supremacy

W.E.B. Du Bois, writings about these racial inequities

Adoption of anti-black racism by new immigrants

Progressives rose as a cohort of urban reformers, called to reform social ills: sanitation, political corruption, food regulation, building codes

White progressives only unified in middle-upper class backgrounds, and high level of education and commitment to serving white communities

Many northern white progressives rejected social Darwinism in White communities and believed for Black communities

Liberals + Racists in these pursuits (condemnation of the White man for stooping to the Black man’s level of criminality)

Great Migration altered this general pattern of neglect

Southern Blacks are the South’s problem, Northern Blacks are their own problem

1890, 25th anniversary of end of slavery the first of many historical signposts for social scientists to evaluate the progress of Black people

Racial researchers turned to statistics, emphasis on using statistics over anecdotal evidence > social survey sampling methods!

Ch 2 - Writing Crime into Race: Racial Criminalization and the Dawn of Jim Crow

Frederick Hoffman, Race Traits, post emancipation statistical data on black criminality, first discourse, nationwide analysis

Actuary and statistician for Prudential insurance, marketed himself as a foreigner

credibility through reliance on data,

race relations writers at the time rooted in sectional conflicts and ideological positions

Witnessed brutality of racism in post-bellum south

Explanation of increase Black mortality rates, tendency of self-destructive nature of Black people, social and economic conditions have ‘nothing to do black criminality’

Hampton Virginia, industrial education for Black people

Healthcare discrimination, physical, emotional, and psychological toll of racial oppression had ‘nothing to do’ with disparities – data does not speak for itself, multiple ways to be interpreted

Rising suicide rates as the stressors of modern life, individuals' victims of social conditions: Hoffman wrote this of White people

Emerging advocacy bidirectional, black mortality a race problem, white mortality a social problem, response to economic inequality

Non-discrimination laws in 1880s for insurance companies led to Hoffman’s role at Prudential

Statistical fact of black men dying written as evidence of inferiority of body

M.V. Ball prison doctor at Eastern State Penitentiary fought back against these ideas, need to compare environmental conditions of varying classes

Social scientists trying to raise their academic profile, ‘give findings the veneer of scientific certainty’

Scientific measure of black criminality awaited freedom, then reliable data

Society and government have a responsibility to protect health and welfare of white citizenry

Disease, death, self-destruction rooted in industrialization and urbanization of modern civilization

White Lies, Black Lies, Statistics, (MV Ball)

Foreign born whites had similar death rates in specific localities based on living conditions

All law breakers are not sent to prison!

Connection between corruption and brutality of police officers

For Hoffman, Black criminality justified proscription, praised the wisdom of insurers

Presenting data for the first time, and setting the terms and shaping frame of analysis

Connected increasing black crime data to rise of Black churches and schools

Went against optimism of liberal northerners who praised industrial education as means of reform for Black communities

Book became a prized source of information for anti-Black writers

Marked the Black urban migrant as a criminal of exceptional nature

Efforts to render racism invisible were paying off

Bulk of questioning against this new crime data came from Black reformers, journalists, scholars

Considered themselves ‘their own best argument,’ asserted hopefulness to inalienable right s of freedom and fairness

Ida B. Wells lost three close friends to lynching after they defended their grocery store! White media applauded the violence

Forceful new arguments: acts of white barbarity toward black men!

Aim to debunk the ravished white woman, highlighted how northerners contributed to the lynching craze in fabricating their own stories

A Red Record, exposing enduring sexual violence, hypocrisy of lynching hysteria, dehumanization of Black bodies

Printing press was destroyed, burned to the ground, left the South and moved to Chicago

Some black writers willing to traffic in the currency of black criminality rates to appeal to white audiences and be taken seriously

W.E.B. Du Bois, wrote about struggles of rebuilding family life after moral foundations were destroyed by slavery

Seminal text on urban sociology, Philadelphia, systematic investigation of facts! Fieldwork

Reject American pseudo-experts

Conservation of the Races speech, racial essentialism, all blacks endowed with the same gifts needing to be unlocked: looked back on this as an embarrassment

Anti-crime self-help, plus white help to end racism

Kelly Miller Black mathematician who launched sociology department at Howard University

Ch 3 – Incriminating Culture: The Limits of Racial Liberalism in the Progressive Era

Frances Kellor, first white female social scientist to publish a major study of Black criminality, debut as northern-born-and-bred liberal scholar, working class roots, commitment to real-world reform

Battery of tests on 90 black female prisoners, and 61 white female prisoners, no biological evidence that criminal type existed, some of first race experiments

Methods unusual among mainstream sociologists, able to move toward environmental critique

Environment must be shown to be of a nature offering every opportunity for development

Refocused debate of what responsibility whites have in solving the problem

Revealed two systems in the US: North reformatory and south punitive

Hoffman remained extremely influential as a crime expert until creation of FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports in the 1930s

Sympathetic whites conflated exceptional opportunities of a tiny minority (of Black people) with circumscribed options of the masses

By debating meaning of high vs low criminality, black writers unwittingly reinforced the importance of crime in defining black life

Much racist reasoning depended on perspective, Kelly Miller compared per capita education costs

Mary White Ovington, leading white settlement house advocate, social survey researcher documenting struggles of northern Black families

Reformers began to see inconsistency between hopeful vision of white criminality vs pessimistic view of black criminality

From this conscious-raising came the seeds of a counter black crime discourse

Half a Man: The Status of the Negro in New York (1911)

Children’s aggressive behavior a response to a racist social environment

Black parent responsibility to teach children to defend their self-pride and personal respect against racial insults from old and new Americans

Highlighted corrupt influences and racially abusive police officers, broadened social content in which black juvenile delinquency can be explained

Less certain about social origins of black female criminality and prostitution, ‘degrading temptation’ charges also impacted poor white and immigrant girls

Slavery had handicapped the Black family, racial defect

Franz Boas, The Mind of the Primitive Man

Rejection of biological determinism, fresh set of perspectives, assimilation of southern and eastern European immigrants was the central focus

Black inferiority a temporary state perpetuated by whites’ “social neglect”

Stopped short of what was offered for white immigrants,

“Culture as both salve and sieve, mediate the line between racial oppression based on hereditarian theories and unambiguous color-blind appeals for reform”

Made the point, there are more genetic variations among individuals of race groups than there are between racial groups

Primarily intended for benefit of new immigrants

Rejection of racial determinism had an incremental and profound impact on the study of black life for liberal race-relations writers

Neither race nor culture fixed by heredity, cited historical achievements of African civilization before colonization

Boas erased the color line and replaced with a culture line, inclusion but a sense of inferior behavior linked to Black people

Even though Kellor discounted race traits, part of her analysis reified the inferiority of blacks as criminals

Second-rate criminals, justification of Black women prostitutes yielding to white men readily, new term capacity signaled language to measure historical and social differences between blacks and whites

Writing crime into culture, emphasized distinctiveness of black thieves, rapists, murderers, trans-Atlantic voyages of Europeans helped to wash away their distinctions

Vision of white immigrants as ‘Americans in process’

Over time, immigrants’ escape from slums due to social reform raised and reinforced doubts of blacks’ cultural readiness

North the universally accepted proving ground of African American fitness for citizenship

Charities editors privileged local knowledge

For many readers, culture was race even if evidence showed otherwise

Jane Adams reformer, apathy, neglect and exploitation of white immigrant youth in Chicago

A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil, Black women were subject to same industrial evils as white women, and racism made matters worse

Domestic work for black women, the least attractive and lowest paid occupation, represented their position in the labor market

Employment opportunities poor

Attacked racism but simultaneously excused it on the grounds Blacks lacked sufficient inherited resources to deal with modern city life

Racial liberals believed most blacks were culturally inferior to whites, they did not shrink from incriminating black culture even as they passionately rejected biological determinism of conservative colleagues

Suggested black women needed additional dose of moral tonic to save their race

Too often, white reformers settled for indexing injustice rather than fighting it

White settlement workers able to navigate the two worlds of the wealth and the working class, and received donations from huge white donors for white social reform

For grassroots reformers and Black social workers acquiring funds was extremely difficult

Forced to choose between no funding or molding programming of institutions to accommodate perspectives of white sponsors

Racism of progressive white women revels the limits black women reformers faced, dependency on philanthropic political support of white elites

Mann Act 1910, prosecution for transporting white women across state lines, color-blind, white slavery, prescribed victimization for whites, trope of the nineteenth century labor movement

Exploited white middle-class anxieties

Created social policy that led to the abandonment of black prostitutes

Anti-prostitution movements distinctly criminalized black women

Black criminality a universal tool to measure black fitness for citizenship, and a tool to shield white Americans from the charge of racism, helping to determine the degree whites had to help

Ch 4 – Preventing Crime: White and Black Reformers in Philadelphia

By focusing on moral character of poor people, settlement house works stigmatized behavior

Philadelphia in the 1930s out-paced other cities in Black population two to one

WEB Du Bois, The Philadelphia Negro

Mother Bethel, Richard Allen, 1816 first church of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) denomination, first independent Black denomination in the north

Octavia Hill Association (OHA), Starr Centre, Susan Wharton

Trained female rent collectors to do social work and raise tenants’ standard of living

Progressive era reforms limited to ‘deserving’ individuals, simultaneously stigmatizing ‘undeserving’ leading to further social inequality

Not enough housing regardless of respectability

OHA demonstrated need for housing reform but at the cost to blacks of conflating slum conditions and criminality

Crime used to justify disenfranchisement, lynching, and Jim Crow laws in the south, and used to justify municipal neglect, joblessness, and residential segregation in the north

Crime experts at the national level, blind to complexities of local causes and conditions

Many nationalized experts did not live among the people they studied; they relied on census bureau statistics and recycled data from local experts to support their opinion

Poor white neighborhoods not as easily characterized by predominance of one foreign group, blacks were more segregated

Immigrant communities were more difficult to stigmatize by criminality of one group

CSH, College Settlement House, on of Philly’s oldest privately run social work agencies

Attempts to minimize inter-group confrontation, officials believed responsibility for street crime was more widely distributed than largely accepted

North House Association (NHA), bad housing conditions for ‘worn out Americans,’ white men of few skills, physically and mentally stunted

White settlement houses chose not to define their work in racial terms

Friends Neighborhood Guild (FNG), goals of civic and social progress, downplaying racial characteristics consistent with Americanization goals of most houses

Immigrants facilitated in becoming more American, summer field trips

Small examples of positive reinforcement work – reveals optimistic attitudes of the settlement workers toward troubled white youth

Pool tables for boys to meet at night, Department for the Older Girls with moral and educational talks

Message that white immigrants were humanity worth saving, that the sky was the limit for reform and their future as law-abiding citizens, not for black people!

Reformers did not go out of their way to stereotype blacks, but they paid no attention to them despite suffering greater isolation and inequality than immigrants

Black behavior defined by white reformers as a racial problem, intensified stigmatization of black crime and made prevention seem unlikely

Black social status in the urban North on a downward trajectory compared to immigrants

Progressive era, broad movement of interracial organizations on the national level

NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

Susan Wharton, in years prior to NAACP, in her work at the Starr Centre, she supported Hampton-Tuskegee model of race progress

National Urban League, NUL

To white readers, pay now with jobs and structural improvements or pay later in juvenile delinquency, crime and disease

Association for the Protection of Colored Women, first and only black-run crime agency in Philadelphia

Armstrong Association, adopted conservative methods of economic reform, dependence on white philanthropy, influence of white churches, and faith in industrial education, promoted a certain conservatism

Washington, Tuskegee & Industrial Education became the targets for white northerners

Lincoln conference, race conference in Cooperstown, NY (1908)

Charity work among blacks was generous compared to job opportunities, many barred them from good jobs yet supported charity

Du Bois, whites preferred two kinds of blacks, the common laborer and the charity case

Paradox of contempt and pity

James Stemons, Philadelphia postal clerk, writer, and reformer, struggled financially to become a full-time reformer, exceptional working-class black intellectual

Participated in the Lincoln conference, blacks abandoned by social service agencies, criticized Booker T. Washington’s self-improvement and bootstrap philosophies

Washington often pitted against Du Bois and the Niagara movement which agitated for civil and political rights to the exclusion of broaching economics

Despite reform work, did cross the line in criminalizing jobless and unemployed blacks

Quakers in PA among the most active supporters of abolition, helped make the Underground Railroad, and established schools to help educate free blacks

Steady stream of migrants from Maryland and Virginia to Philly intensified class and status divisions and gave way to larger more diverse communities

For black writers and reformers, highlighting black criminality was a double-edged sword, it defended the conservative self-help solution

Ch 5 – Fighting Crime: Politics and Prejudice in the City of Brotherly Love

Liberals claimed crime as a function of economic forces, instead of individual failure, but many supported vice crusades in major cities (1911 – 1917)

Movement to close red-light districts focused on symptoms of inequality instead of causes

Tenderloin district in Philadelphia

Writers for the Philadelphia Tribune highlighted disparities of crime fighting, anticrime forces descended on Black communities acting with impunity and disregarded rights

Blacks themselves contributed to racialization of crime prevention by linking racial progress to crime fighting

Philadelphia turned a deaf ear to goals of black crime fighters

Vice arrests made part of normal routine for police, unique under Mayor Blankenburg was an official policy of anti-vice efforts

Head of Keystone party, attacked police corruption

Assembled a committee of local anti-vice reformers, none were black

Blankenburg wanted to work with white moral reformers to save whites from being criminals

Inasmuch Mission, ‘Hell’s Half Acre’ in Philly, area declared clean in his first year in office, became Philadelphia’s model for a near whites-only community

Episcopal Church of Philadelphia absorbed Inasmuch

Episcopal churches beginning to take the lead in mission work among white prostitutes and pimps in North Philadelphia

Churches engaged in what practically amounts to police work, touring and reporting disorderly houses, and charting them

Grant Williams, African American journalist for the tribune, called this crackdown an attempt to turn the area into white settlement

Incidents of racial discrimination within Blankenburg administration

two black employees refused admittance to public works dinner

At least nineteen black employees lost jobs due to racism in city departments

Sixth and Eighth police districts in North Philadelphia were overwhelmingly white and working class in 1912, with a small Black population

South Philadelphia, the nineteenth district, encompassed ‘Philadelphia’s Black Belt,’ this district had the most Black arrests than any other, and the most black police officers

Public safety director Porter praised policemen

Under the new reform mayor Blankenburg, whites looked out for their own, the mayor gave no support to the LCPR

Racial violence toward blacks from white people, and white police officers, as well as corrupt white community members

Population increases from the Great Migration set off violent tendencies in white men, African American men the most underemployed and lowest-paid male works in Philly, complaints about stealing jobs from whites had no basis

During the anti-vice crusade, police reform and crime prevention came at the expense of black’s safety from assaults by white civilians

Tribune warns the city to take notice and reports on incidents

Stigma of criminality at the onset of the Progressive era was reinforced by the failure of white politicians and moral reformers to prioritize crime prevention among blacks as they had for whites

Growth of black middle class produced many black public intellectuals and reformers

Many waxed negatively about roughness of southern migrants

Debate about Black southerners, as justification for increasing discrimination, segregation, and violence in the North was an idea at least 20 years old by 1916

Black commentators tried to strike a balance between blaming individuals and blaming society

Intra-racial southern culture became more meaningful and problematic to black northerners trying to minimize the stigma of criminality

Black woman and historian Sadie T. Mossell, study of the Great Migration in Philadelphia

Research showed migrants had failed to adjust to their new environment, but were directly responsible for the downward turn in race relations

Had Mossell not been interested in blaming migrants, she could have presented a critique of structural inequality shaped by white racism

Two themes highlighted, segregation in housing, segregation in recreation

Higher wages that brought migrants canceled out by price gouging in segregated black areas

Mossell not the only observer to conflate white hostility and discrimination against blacks with migrants’ difficulty in achieving middle-class social status and respectability

Emmett Scott, first black assistant to secretary of war, study of black migration during WWI, idea that migrants’ new freedom in the North was used against them, characterization of liberty comes with a built-in penalty

Contempt black northerners felt legitimized continued white prejudice against all blacks

Rhetoric implied that but for black migrants, there would be no racial problems

This contempt was part of what led to the outbreak of race riots in 1917 and 1918, plus new pro-vice leadership of Mayor Smith

White mobs roamed streets assaulting blacks and set fire to their homes. Immediate cause was crisis of overcrowded housing due to migration in older black areas

Upwardly mobile blacks who could afford to move away started to do so

Housing related attacks increased, families’ homes set ablaze, looting, Tribune instructed law abiding blacks to defend themselves

Whites of questionable, often criminal, backgrounds used violence to resist residential encroachment of innocent Black people

Lieutenant of the 17th police district denied racist intent of assaults, black leaders sharply criticized his failure to protect blacks’ property

Thieves looted and carted away Black belongings and redistributed them to white neighbors, police often cooperated, no arrests made

Many white police officers aided mobs by disarming blacks

Black gun ownership subject to unlawful scrutiny

Director of public safety, William Wilson, issued an order to gun dealers to cease sales to blacks, though he denied this racial bias

Disproportionate arrests due to criminalization of black resistance to white violence. Black self-defense, especially with aid of a weapon, was treated as criminal offense regardless of circumstance

Response of black leaders to hold a protest meeting, mayor unavailable playing golf, presented a letter of rage, and suggested more effective use of black police officers

17th district police staff transferred and replaced by an interracial staff with a new lieutenant, Tribune praised this change

Black race relations experts blamed migrant criminality for legitimizing white contempt, laying all the blame on white racism would mean an acceptance of little-no control of their own futures

Residential segregation in the North relied on the powerful racial imagery of black criminals

Black resistance justified whites' initial assumption that blacks were a threat to white communities

White resistance to demand for better housing by middle class blacks, amid heightened expectations born from war, caused the riots

Ch 6 – Policing Racism: Jim Crow Justice in the Urban North

The 1920s – 1930s saw the Great Migration coupled with prohibition. Created wide-scale opportunities for white vice owners and corrupt politicians to hide illegal activities under a cover of blackness

Relocation of white organized crime to black communities

Race-based criminal justice benefitted white leaders by making it less likely red-light districts would spring up in white areas

Behind borders of Black districts many officials participated as patrons, protectors, and owners of illegal operations with drugs, liquor, gambling, and prostitution

Vice districts mostly owned, operated, and regulated by white power structures

Black reformers reasoned solving crime would be best if each race attacked half of the problem. Black expected to police their own criminals, whites expected to police their own racists

Intensification of antiracist activities with a focus on criminal justice systems

Debate shifted left with mounting evidence of police corruption

1930 editorial in National Urban League magazine, Opportunity, policing racism as an effective counter-discourse to long-standing discourse of inferiority

Bias in juvenile justice system, became one of the most effective demonstrations that structural inequality was the cause of crime

Black social workers increasingly involved in recreation programs and probation work

Civil rights workers launched publicity campaigns against police brutality and racial profiling

Racial violence and bloodshed, Red Summer of 1919

Two views emerged to explain bloodshed

Emmett Scott & Sadie T. Mossell, blaming black southern migrants, too much freedom meant excessive crime rates

Henderson H. Donald, black sociology graduate from Yale, underscored northern whites’ treatment of migrants, drew attention to disproportionate arrests in minor and petty offenses, police activity at the root of so-called Black crime in the US

Police violence and misconduct had long been front-page news in black newspapers like the Philadelphia Tribune, but linking discriminatory police behavior was a new approach

Black social scientists embraced the social scientific approach to depict the humanity of black people and to document the impact of institutional and societal racism

1919, NAACP effort to discredit black male rape myth by sending letters to county officials across the country requesting black rape statistics

Excessive crime rates among blacks represented a policing problem instead of a crime problem

1922 report of Chicago Commission on Race Relations, The Negro in Chicago, twelve-members, eleven-month investigation

Chicaho School sociologists discernibly absent

Emerging sociological shift to an urban ecological approach to explain inner-city criminality and juvenile delinquency

At no point before 1922 had any published study argued that racial crime statistics were too unreliable to be usable, unprecedented decision of the Chicago commission to disregard figures influenced important members of the social scientific community

Carter G. Woodson, founder of Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, food analogy for why crime is not racial, ‘Irish salt or Malay bananas’

Among some officials, legacy of Racial Darwinism continued into the third decade of the 20th century

Two rhetorical strategies helped white liberals obfuscate appearance of slipping into old racist discourses

Juxtaposed black cultural inferiority in the North with racist police behavior

Presented arguments as part of the product of legitimate black perspectives and research

William T. Root, white psychologist, used black case workers in his prison study, adopted recommendation that white people seek information from Blacks

Newly formed critical mass of black researchers, representative of professional class of ‘law-abiding citizens’

Cohort of black women and men became authorities on black criminality: sociologists, social workers, probation officers, criminal justice officials, journalists, civil rights workers

Anna J. Thompson, highlighted unfair treatment of police officers and judges, inflation of black arrests due to police raids, 1/3 of all black arrests discharged

Ira De A. Reid, NUL director of research and publicity, evidence in surveys of crime and policing, indiscriminate arrests later suspended, discharged or adjourned

Police agencies throughout the North involved directly with anti-black violence

System overburdened, number of violations within population exceeded those that could be prosecuted

Many officials flouted constitutional rights of black suspects

Gilyard hoax, one of many instances of racial scapegoating, suicide that was framed as murder by black men for Gilyard to maintain insurance policy for family

Black sociologist, Monroe N. Work continued work of Wells by compiling false accusations

Numerous entrenched interests opposed to effective policing of black communities

Many profited from perpetuating vice

Hellish tenement houses enrich landlords and breed criminals, officials often collected protection money from vice operators sometimes while soliciting prostitutes

Police officers also ran their own shady places

Whites dominated ownership and management of vice

NAACP officials issued press releases about police misconduct

Discussions of prohibition’s failures drew a color line through reform attempts to redress the impact of the underground economy

Police and federal officials began to collaborate on national crime reporting system

Counter groundswell of public criticism

Law enforcement concerned about their image, President Hoover convened National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement in 1929 > Uniform Crime Reports of 1930

Nation’s first comprehensive crime data system – used to this day – not a success

Standardized ’reliable’ statistics did not change daily reality of racial bias among police officers

Concerned blacks’ vision of effective policing in the 1920s and 1930s had its roots in Progressive era community policing initiatives of black crime fighters like James Stemons

Democracy’s Data (Dan Bouk)

A Note on Method & Stories on Data

History Lab at Colgate University, reviewed thousands of sheets in microfilm of once physical US census sheets, reliance on census historian Margo Anderson

What is our democracy if this is its data?

Stories in the Data

Census as an opportunity to understand the democratic potential of data

Old fashioned big data, 1940 census paved the way for modern statistical sampling methods and advanced computing in government

State power in governing proportional to official population

We are all counted and all become enumerators

Genealogical inquires drive a lot of exploration about data

Dataset as a text, authors and subjects

Latin for ‘things given’

Ch 1: The Question Men

March 1939 conference, chairman Dr. Louis Dublin, Metropolitan Life Insurance, growth of federal government since the last census, ‘alphabet soup’ of the New Deal

‘You cannot know your country, unless your country knows you’

Get counted or your community suffers

Commerce interests present included board chair of Sears mail order catalog, made possible by growth of the USPS, General R. E. Wood

Relationships between Wood and new Roosevelt administration, connecting big business, many distrusted Roosevelt’s decision to leave the gold standard

Wood believed in inflation, greater purchasing power

Sentiment of markets as people, ‘to know America as a market’

Metropolitan Life Insurance, ‘socialist’ activities like annual physical exams, and public health campaigns, justified as investment

An economic case for health interventions, an uphill battle for Dublin with superiors, had access to reliable figures in the employer’s ‘statistical stash’ which were made widely available in Statistical Bulletin

American Federation of Labor, representing unions in the Dept of Commerce auditorium ‘a place to campaign for data about the masses for the masses’

Newest breed of political actor: academics/professional statisticians

Roosevelt and his “Brains Trust”

Idea of the university that served the State a German idea, American students and their money buoyed the German university systems

New kind of social science (ex: W.E.B. Du Nois, 1899 social survey, German style of social science applied to the study of race in the US)

Data driven methods of German social science entered the Census Bureau, generation of mathematically sophisticated, demographers

Eugenics during this time respected > Hitler’s regime across Europe with eugenics at the center of policy

Manipulation of social and economic contexts of childbearing

Eugenic nudging!

Louis Dublin a prominent racial liberal, millions of Black policy holder’s (and their data) to prove vitality of Black people

Insisted the Black population would catch up in life expectancy > policy holders paid more for less coverage

Census made the facts its columns defined, hid the facts its columns denied, earlier Census had immigration a central point

Congress used this data to set immigration quotes

Excluded freed people and Native Americans from analysis which denied quota space from slaves descended of Africans

> Black activism to demand congress lower representation in states with disenfranchisement

Choices in the census lead to policy decisions

Attempts for question input on disabilities, and religious practice for the first time, both failed to get included

Reproductive potential, data to reveal which groups weren’t bearing offspring, (predictions of fertility or other measures > )

Probability met statistics, the democratic “experiment” cast in a radical, mathematical light: Sampling

*Supplemental questions about fertility included in select sheets for questioning, a line separating these

Convinced Congress to authorize an entire Census of Housing to run alongside population and agriculture censuses

Migration a key focus in this census (residence 5 years ago vs present), Dust Bowl refugees, Southern tenant farmers and the mass movement of Black folks

The income question indicates a land of wage workers

Life insurance served as a modern substitute for land and wealth

Dominance of the wage calls into being a welfare state

Income information promised a map of purchasing power to be exploited by big business!

Historian of quantification, Caitlin Rosenthal, ‘frame’ of data, headings

Ch 2: Names and Negotiations

1944 Langston Hughes, poem about names in the census, who controls identity? Respect and honor wrapped up in the act of counting

Legal papers mattered increasingly, all births after 1933 had to be recorded, migrants entering needed visas, permits, or health certificates > emergence of the ‘undocumented’ or ‘illegal alien’

1937 social security program

Power of the enumerator to write down what they wanted

House numbers essentially names of state offices assigned to lodgings

Alternating odds and even house numbers, made it easier to conduct 1790 census

Accidental benefits of an apparatus meant to serve data makers

System of counting and naming derived from, and reinforced, practices of early American democracy

Statistics kept by insane asylums, illusion of mass insanity amongst free Blacks

“Blind and insane” grouping for whites, “insane and idiots” grouping for Black people, tally of senile white people incorrectly put in colored columns

Illusion of excess idiocy and insanity in Black population

Failure in the data management system

Decision to name each free person in the 1850 census

Ordering, grouping, adding responsibilities moved away from the enumerator

Individualization of data, politics assured the revolutionary potential of this was minimized

Utility of names and importance of asserting control over them: Frederick Douglass

Names are things we use, as well as others use; to grasp onto a sense of us, names are social technologies

District employee Wesley Pawl, Wesley Pawloski, Wesley Paul

Ch 3: Partners

How does a dataset encompass those it never imagined?

Margaret Scattergood, living with two other women, designation of ‘partner’ in the relation column, census of households

Struggles to make sense of those living outside traditional family structures

1880 statisticians given authority to organize recruitment of enumerators

‘Relation’ questions could be an attempt to keep an eye on enumerators, officials faced fraudulent people counting, ‘padding’

Often added as lodgers or borders in existing households, relation made it easier to detect fraudulent entries

Points to belief in a ‘normal’ family that could be detected and vetted

“Partners” worked well for merchant capitalism, made it possible to aggregate unattached, usually male workers

Chinese immigrant men living together, working in California

Nevada Italian immigrants in mining industry

1940 instructions told enumerators, ‘If two or more persons who are not related by blood or marriage share a common dwelling, write head for one and partner for the other/others’

Furniture defining a family changed too from table > households of sinks and stoves

Boston or Wellesley marriages, pairs of women independent of financial support from a man, highly educated, shared a home, engaged in an intimate relationship

Roosevelt’s New Deal, Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)

Security maps, grading residential areas, collaboration with real estate agents, redlining, ‘hazardous’ zones

Federal Housing Administration relied on these maps, considering these maps of yellow and red areas as the margins

Greenwich Village

Married people living apart from their spouses treated as anomalous and a group subject to statistical scrutiny

Hawaii Partners, 2-3 percent, as much as ten times as many partners as one might expect based on US census distribution numbers

Plantation workers, often widowed or separated Filipino men living together, Japanese migrants as well, though they were often placed in more skilled and semiskilled positions

Partner labeled made masses of colonial proletariat look like members of a household

A release valve for enumerators encountering queer couples, colonial laborers, rent-sharing roommates, or recent migrants

Ch 4: Counting with Friends

Reliance on hundreds of thousands of enumerators, each leaving a unique mark on census sheets

Dependence on local knowledge

Stories behind enumerator selection reveal powerful politics and technical forces

Mississippi enumerators stories, census bureau director William Austin, made appointments himself, powerful job selections in an economically depressed era (1939)

Austin saw the transition of the census from ad-hoc operation to scientific agency

Mother, Susan also an enumerator and Austin had early work in the bureau as a bookkeeper

One of the states with the fewest black enumerators!

Enumerators as a ‘field force’ compared to the mass-mobilization of military effort

Area manager, new for 1940 census, oversaw training of politically appointed district supervisors

Legislators wanted loyalty that handing out a job provided, Roosevelt signed off on all these new supervisors

Separation of politics and statistics is a fantasy

“Friends” and patronage as currency in appointments, many southern fathers begging the education of their ‘girls’

Exams to confirm appointments, two rounds, one from local college professor, the next from DC census experts, who did not talk about ‘friendship’

Testing helped counteract some patronage

Division of Statistical Research for the Bureau (DSR) put on a 2-month training for area managers, while ‘regular enumerators’ had less formal instruction

Tests tools for bureaucrats to seize control of hiring from politicians

Civil service exams, often designed with native-born whites in mind, or those with access to elite education, justification for exploitation of Black people and immigrants

Exams for census workers were about evaluating how well they could follow census instructions; how accurately could they record what the state wanted recorded

Teaching and testing instead of patronage, cultivating competitions for influence and resources

Ch 5: Silences and White Supremacy

Data never speaks for itself, anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, how and why silences are produced in the making of history

Daniel O’Haver Price, 1947 sociology graduate student, used US government database of Selective Service registration, draft registration had unavoidable ‘teeth,’ a good way to confirm census count

Unplanned test of census completeness

1940 census did a poor job of counting African Americans, underestimated by 13%

Census showed Mississippi has having more white people, which was used as evidence of Black inferiority despite the count being untrue

Previous Black researchers had already uncovered undercounting! Black mathematician, Kelly Miller

Frederick Hoffman, Race Traits, Prudential insurance statistician, helped certify the inferiority of Black people, Miller argued against this blaming of Black bodies

Miller postulated undercounting resulting from mobile population of Black people, upset by the world war and migration to cities

Hoffman blaming Black bodies was a refusal to acknowledge systematic flaws in counting

Mexican Americans in the 1930s faced possibility of statistical erasure

“Mex” race fields crossed out and replaced with “1,” translating to White

Enumerators seldom asked for race, and were not interested in racial self-conceptions

Blood a potent metaphor for parentage or ancestry, frequently invoked by law

Mexican American War in the now U.S. Southwest

Mexicans who remained in the ceded region became citizens after 1 year, ‘we didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us’

Government conferred possibility of claiming whiteness, but most languished in a political purgatory, living as colonial subjects in New Mexico territory prior to statehood

Early decades of the 20th century drew workers for agricultural and mining interests

Legal crossings of the border meant dehumanizing practices of ‘disinfection plants’

Border patrols emerged, initially to stop Chinese and Japanese immigrants

Policing widened, thousands forced out by formal or informal deportation every year

Mexicans became the prototype for a new class of person, the illegal alien

1930s, “Mexican” its own non-white racial category on the census, statistical shift intensified already growing vulnerability

Thousands shipped out, mass deportations, racial otherness made them expendable and scapegoats for economic depression

Immigrants stood a court decision away from losing their path to citizenship

Social Security forms rolled out in 1936, prerequisite to getting a job, threatened to racialize every Mexican American worker

League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) fought back but without success

Segregated statistics, as in the Jim Crow south, made it easier to ignore unequal treatment of people living in segregated neighborhoods

Leaders began clawing their way back to statistical whiteness, foreign policy came to dictate statistical policy for the 1940 census

“Mex” labels tell us more about the enumerator than those counted

“Indians not taxed,” active data label for nearly half a century, recognition taxation should not be demanded from those whom representation is not allocated

19th century had US gov count Native Amerians as a prelude to seizing lands

Category was labeled and then subtracted in statistics

1885, superintendents of reservations got instructions to submit an annual census roll, alternate counts and documents key in the removal of this category and freeing indigenous people from the statistical volatility

Congress members sought power of full counts

Constitutional convention, three-fifths compromise, in practice congress seldom issues direct taxes, inclusion of this was to obscure the degree of interest for slave states

Fourteenth amendment granting citizenship included a threat that states be stripped of representation power to the proportion of Black disenfranchisement

Violence did not intimidate Black voters, so the job of stealing elections was completed by local officials

NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, James Weldon Johnson, presented to congress ratio of voters to potential voters

Would rather exclude African Americans from the apportionment count, than remains paws of a white supremacist regime

Black enumerators underrepresented everywhere, but in Mississippi practically excluded

Ch 6: Uncle Sam v. Senator Toby

Census as a field for political combat, Republican NY senator tried to score political points at the census’ expense, Daniel Reed, recast census as an army and occupying force

Enumerators as invading privacy

Former colleague, Charles Tobey, took this fight to the Senate, census questions as violating privacy, ordinary people compelled to answer under threat of imprisonment

Broadcast spots on the radio to warn Americans of ‘census snooping,’ received letters of support from American people

Amid great depression, dawn of an aggressive welfare state, those for and against economically interventionist government contested opinions through the census

Every second census overlapped with every fifth national election, chaos

Nothing accidental in the way the census became a partisan flash point

Republican critics of the New Deal hammered risks of ‘regimentation,’ implication was clear: first they come for your economic data, then for your freedom!

Forerunner to today’s database politics: card indices, federal government realized the power of the index card, Social Security Board collected and managed records of tens of millions

Britain installed a more extensive welfare state, without the same sort of data surveillance

US built card indices because it modeled welfare programs on private insurance practices

Reliance on payroll taxes led to disproportionate burden on poor wage workers

Roosevelt’s welfare system aimed to shore up capitalism, not overthrow it

WWII causes a massive expansion of the income tax

Before this war, income tax had limited reach, Tobey cried discrimination that poor people had to disclose precise income, while the rich could hide in a $5000+ bracket

Many Americans feared local gossip more than the specter of the state

Enumerators were neighbors whose judgment they wished to avoid

Those who wanted to resist the income questions found subtle ways to do so, some gamed the census claiming self-employed to hide their hard-won pittances

Examples of resistance within census sheets

To know America, each American had to submit to being known

Ch 7: The Inventory and the Arsenal

Population data crucial to the war effort, the most essential commodity of war is people, US military enlisted the census inventory as part of its arsenal

Iwao Milton Moriyama, federal government worker in the census division of vital statistics

Halls of the Department of Commerce building couldn’t accommodate church of paper and calculators census required > office buildings meant to be temporary so the operations for 1940 census took place in a rented warehouse

Geography Division set up drafting and printing hundreds of thousands of maps to guide the count

Drafting tools, compasses, scissors, T-squares, magnifying glasses

Geographers divided the country so enumerators could quantify

Ten times more people, ~6,000, required to translate America’s answers into reliable facts

Beginning in 1920’s gov built new and elegant spaces for white employees and visitors, shipped more congested, louder, dirtier work elsewhere, Census Bureau’s heavy machinery ended up in DCs black neighborhoods

“Robots” to tabulate the 1940 census, punched cards and electric tabulating equipment

Census took credit for inventing the punch card, preparing for the computer and information age, inspired by conductor tickets, individual information on paper cards

Bureau first civilian purchaser of an electronic computer (room-size UNIVAC) for the 1950 census

Technicians also developed optical mark technology, and pre-GPS nation-spanning digital maps

Census workers much like the silent, invisible labor of ai technologies today, though they were afforded greater protections

Knowledge factory, photos published emphasize pieces of machinery, not workers

Bowling and softball within employees (office culture!) Segregated

One crucial activity did cross the color line: union organizing

United Federal Workers of America (UFWA), one of three unions representing census workers

Sought economic justice before social equality

Jobs tended to be temporary, bureau used objective error rates and efficiency ratings to justify discriminatory hiring and firing patterns

For all the emphasis on technology, the most fundamental work, counting for representatives, happened quietly, without fanfare, and by hand

Presidential proclamation the census was not to be used to achieve other kinds of compulsion, war challenged these ideas and commitments

US Attorney General office sent a proposal to amend legislation so surveillance agencies could gain access to individual census responses for espionage investigation, Roosevelt denies but was open to providing them with information on a specific person

Threat of war, fear of sabotage, made census records appear quite valuable

Roosevelt required all defense workers be US citizens

For a fee, census transmuted enumerator’s long-ago jottings into a formal, official certificate proving a person’s age and citizenship status

Bureau joined supply chain, arsenal of democracy, by becoming a supplier of personal data, nearly 800,000 requests per year

Crucial to make the bureau a fast reliable broker for individuals of their own data

Chief statistician lent services to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to help design alien-registration forms

Census used cards sorted by race, JP, and shared them with the military, FBI, and local authorities, advisory committee cheered on these efforts

No one voiced any concerns about ethics of tabulation of Japanese in the country

Officials tried to make the bureau as useful to the war effort as possible, while keeping up with ordinary tasks of census tabulation

Much of the additional work during the war involved tracking essential goods prices and keeping tabs on productive capacity of American industry

How many could be drafted and how many could be enlisted to wartime factories?

Japanese Americans forced out of their homes, barred from the entire West Coast

Government systematically rounded up citizens and non-citizens alike, incarcerated indefinitely in concentration camps

Humiliation and surveillance persisted despite sacrifices and services made by Japanese Americans supporting the war efforts

US Secret service requested information on every person of Japanese descent in DC, ostensibly to protect the president

In coming decades, congress tightened confidentiality laws, bureau put in place procedures and internal review boards meant to protect against the release of data that could identify individuals or single out small groups

Ch 8: The Data’s Depths

Affection for the vision of democracy reduced to questions, that it appeals to a belief in good design that produces good systems

Blank forms, handbook and curriculum, training films, all sought to remove individuality

Within responses that break expectations, limits on centralized control are clear

Census interview at its best, a moment of cooperative civic action

Enumerators held the power of the pen

Doorstep encounters became negotiations and contents playing out across the gaps of classes and groups, celebration of effort and cleverness of people that found a way to be themselves in the census, or protect themselves from it

Pleasure in these tiny subversive maneuvers

Bureau officials did not erase chaos, they kept careful records

Beginning with the 1890 census, statisticians quantified confusion, measures of error

Estimation of undercounts became a fixture of every census evaluation

It at least got better at acknowledging shortcomings

In 1950, implemented a post-enumeration survey, a mini census to create an estimate of how many people were missed nationally

No amount of effort can remove or accurately quantify profound uncertainties that plague complex systems like the census

The more we read data, the more we play in the muck from which all good data is made, the more resilient we will be for looking at complicated data making processes

We need more investigations into data histories

Published data tends to turn feral

Once data was out the door, people could do all kinds of things with it

Apportionment data, two different methods for dividing 435-seat house, ‘major fractions’ favored large populations, ‘equal proportions’ favored small populations

1941, congress switched to equal proportions

Picked this method to suit the ruling party’s interests and make the system automatic, pointing toward a shift to automatized, algorithmic government

Census data helped call into being ‘a consumers’ republic’ (Lizabeth Cohen)

Researchers devised statistics model techniques for US population, using rates of birth, death and migration

Anticipated ‘maturity,’ of the US population, and then the Baby boom hit, these statisticians cast continued growth of the US as a problem, and so helped invent the idea of the disruptive Baby boom, challenged the premise of a prediction powered welfare state

72-year rule protecting census data, tells a story about democracy, speaks to an ideal that protects individual privacy

In an age of big, commodified data, a commitment to confidentiality that spans decades deserves some wonder

Epilogue

March 2020, census arrive via mail, author’s personal experience filling out the census

First time Bureau allowed submission online

Hire private contractor to build self-response form, it proved unreliable, at the last minute the census substituted its own

Between 1940 – 2020 census, massive increase in enumerators, 120k to 635k in 2010

Standardization efforts of enumerators had significant limits

Shift to ‘self-enumeration,’ bureau decided error wouldn’t decrease but it preferred random, unpredictable error of census takers vs. ‘cluster error’ of trained census takers

Development in 1960’s put pressure on census data and “small-area data”

Civil rights advocates, major victories in supreme court cases, ‘one person, one vote’

LBJ, Johnson great Society legislative agenda, ramped up distribution of federal $ to fight poverty, improve housing, provide health care to underserved

Congressed passed laws tying funding to population levels

What does it say about American democracy that there are so few questions (on the modern census)?

Another data revolution intervened: sampling to extrapolate characteristics of the whole

Core questions, ‘short form,’ to all Americans. Additionally, one in four households had to answer additional questions, ‘long form’ sample

Sampling saved time and money, new options for deeper investigation

2010, census created annual American Community Survey (ACS)

For many social knowledge questions, the decennial census would no longer be the direct tool for making an investigation, provides a baseline ground truth

Something lost when mass participation gives way to probabilistic modeling

Trump administration, secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross pushed to add a question about citizenship

Bureau officials called fould, concerns about participation, States also concerned about uncounted residents

Civil rights groups filed lawsuits, supreme court ruled against Ross

Bureau printing schedule demanded immediacy and so the question wasn’t added

Self-enumeration added shift in worldviews, how a person understood themselves would matter more than how a bureau employee might understand that person

1990 “unmarried partner” category added

National LGBTQ Task Force campaigned to get same-sex couples to check the new box, queering the partner option

Bouk describes challenges of race fitting neatly in a box, the compromises people make and different perspectives within those compromises

Census broke promises of confidentiality in WWII with releasing fine-grain tabulations of Japanese Americans, with addresses

New techniques make it possible to discern individual information from census aggregates, Bureau responded with “Disclosure Avoidance System”

Adding ‘noise’ to the dataset to blur, and prevent breakdown

Preservation and protection of individual data an old problem

Census produced its own scans, microfilm sheets, durable and replicable

What is the digital age equivalent of a fire-proof vault?

Beginning with 2010 census, National Archives switched to digital only storage

Delay in 2020 census, necessary, inevitable with pandemic

In 1929, apportion became a zero-sum game, but before this Congress would increase House size every 10 years to accommodate growing US population, no one would lose a seat

In this breakdown, as the population grows, representatives serve more people, 700,000!

Too many people for one representative

No good reason to be racing for seats

Every dataset has a doorstep, a place where plans and dreams meet the throbbing tumult of experience, and from such encounters, via eruptions of ingenuity, we get these strange texts that bear the label ‘data’

The Black Technical Object, Ramon Amaro

Introduction

Recurrent cycles of racialized information, technology of machine learning is preconditioned by a process that conceived Black beings as objects

Blackness as an object enters in relation with the technical object, readied for algorithmic reassembly through the white imaginary

Offensive system of techno-human inequity

What is the Black object to build a new relation with machine learning? What if the Black technical object were to travel through algorithmic and arrive at self-actualization?

Seeking to understand what technology might allow for the reconfiguration of Black being

We Believe in Data

Supernatural belief in the vague idea of data, in which the West is confident, loses efficacy outside of the obsession of social administration

Reliant on reinstatement of logical ‘truths’ made actionable by systems of categorizations (Erin – taxonomies) > executed by management of knowledge-based procedures (Erin – Catherine Liu and Virtue Hoarders)

Any use of technology aims at more efficient racial hierarchization (pessimistic end), machine learning functions for whiteness and its consumer subsidiary

Collective life reduced to one giant math problem!

Machine learning enables penetration of racial logics into social milieu

Power remains obscure in these systems, shielded as error or inefficiency

Knowledge enacted through sciences which are proxies for ‘objective truth’

Foucault & Power

Invest in the discovery of the real practices of power, power passes through individuals, it's not applied to them

Data as a common locus that rests beneath displacement of racialized, establish values of difference as the subject

Principles of race serve as calculable principles of otherness, exclusion and segregation

Why Fanon?

Parallel between Foucault’s biopower, and Fanon’s accounts of subject formation

Emphasis on colonialism and the naturalization of race as the basis from which all sociality is understood

Epistemic operation of categorization, a ‘drama’ of discovery

Fragmented body is not a passive vessel, technology can be a means for the colonized body to generate new forms of radical subjectivity

Digital Epidermis

“Digital epidermalization” - methods by which power is exercised through the disembodiment of the Other under the gaze of surveillance and technologies

Black body is restricted and asked to willfully participate in its own regulation

Achille Mbembe, colonial expansion as a historical consistency of segregation, mass discretization of space, and human extermination, politics of exception

Biopolitics and Necropolitics

Fanon’s solution, racial imaginary can be disrupted through auto-actualization when the individual takes on a psychic refusal to representation

Individual freedom found by prioritizing the future

Data prioritizes the past as a prediction of future in mathematical certainty

Possible resolutions to negation are found in invention, accounts of one’s own lived experiences

How has data become a proxy for individual and collective decision-making?

Chapter 1, As If: Critical Thoughts on Gaining Access to Black Aspiration

Joy Buolamwini, Aspire Mirror, wearing a white mask to be recognized

Computer vision, to interpret visual array and objects within a detected environment

Assumptions simplified through probabilistic priors

Incomputable and unexplained becomes assigned function and meaning in the model’s own logic and calculation

Human perception includes various cues carrying information: edge structure, binocular disparity, color, shading, texture, motion vector fields, this information is typically inconsistent

‘Visual coherence’ from machines requires functional reduction of inconsistency and instability

Algorithms simulate complexity by means of reduction and simplification

Characterization of the living as a set of preexisting conditions, operation of human beings as an assemblage

Subsumed into a homogenous unity of existence

Beyond Reality Face, face tracking software development kit (SDK)

Frames per second algorithm (FPS) active shape model algorithm (ASM), statistical models of shape to confirm suggested shapes

Psychiatrist, Fanon and operations of race, propositions around realm of psychic and collective individual

Possibility of self-determination opened only under condition that the individual alters the self

Objectification of the individual, psychic fragmentation

Phobic Image of the self,’ self-doubt, paranoia

Techno-human relations, detectability is necessary, solution of coherence

Bell Hooks, abiding connection between white supremacy and institutionalization of mass media of specific images, representations of race and blackness that maintain

Commitment within research to organize certain life with rules of occlusion

Undetectable black technical object, machinic nonexistence

Computation is the compulsive ordering of human attributes, Judith Butler gender critique, otherness emerges when we enact nouns of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ as abiding substances

Ian Hacking, social frameworks increasingly rely on reasoning for scientific method, false idea of population phenomena through symbolic sampling

Universal constants, deviations from this are deduced as perturbations of naturalized events that can be returned to equilibrium

Chaotic phenomena with a statistical order

Pro typical behavior for control, the ‘average man’

Departures from pattern are disruptions in the ‘natural trajectory of evolution’

The White Object remains whole while the Black technical object is lodged, attempting to recapture Black life from the confines of ‘normalized logic’

Moten & Harney, is there an aspirational Black life that can gain a right of refusal to representation?

Computation as fact, police surveillance as managerial oversight

Ezekiel Dixon-Román, ‘algo-ritmo,’ disciplining of the flesh, classification as reconfiguration of ontologies of human in relation to technology

Freezing of life to a homogenous milieu is the suppression of lived conditions catalyze individual transformation and inform future iterations of being

Revision demands return to metaphysics and perspective of multivalent modes of reality

Harney and Moten, entropic individual exceeds barriers of social relations to enter an alternate state of becoming

Entropy, a system inclusive of contingency

Chapter 2, Sociogeny and the Recapitulation of Racialized Being

Freud, ontogenesis, psychoanalysis theory of development of an individual from the perspective of life events > after ontogenesis, phylogenic analysis, family analysis

Humans suffer delusion of power over other species

Intervene as mediator with the ‘megalomanic individual’

Recapitulation process – evolution, misguided links between primitive ‘savage’ and individual patient neurosis

Psychoanalysis silent on the effect of economic and political disparities

Evidence of supremacy of mind, most ‘skilled in the arts of the mind’

For the racialized, the sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of colonized people is not nature (pg. 69)

Characterized by death, violence, exploitation

Fanon, sociogeny – product of the historical realities of anti-blackness, racial being internalizes how they are perceived by the dominant other >

Recurrent cycles of neurosis and social objectification

Sociogeny, mind/body dialect

Spaces between being and cycles of racial hierarchy are disruptive to the process of self-actualization

Internal self must confront external colonial environments, end their own internal colonization or they will be repressed by anger, resentment and aggression

Law of algorithmic offers defense in claim for recognition

Machinic sociogenesis seeks a more complete understanding of racialized occurrences in the development of ML

‘Structuralism provided fanon with a discourse that could better account for the fact of Blackness,’ the Black body is generated and self-generates outside the concept of human

Du Bois, the veil, spiritual and philosophical associations, double consciousness

Spiritual strivings of former slaves and complexity of their lives post emancipation

A sense of always looking, racial subjection divides the soul

‘Other world,’ view of themselves through gaze of whiteness

‘Truer self,’ spiritual striving toward new essentialism > self-actualization

Need to realign ontological assumptions toward a less reductive account of Black lived experience

Individual is the dominant agent in self-actualization

Master-slave relation, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel – slave lacks courage to resist tyranny, freedom through discipline, work ethic, Christian forgiveness

Results in abstraction of the body into a collection of measurable functions

Man becomes conscious of himself through desire for recognition

Fanon, racialized human an integrated yet excluded category of species

Crisis of this truth in the specificity of Black psychic fragmentation, psychosocial alienation of the Black subject

Justification of science of human sorting

Racism is not a constant of the human spirit, expressed as an obedience to ‘flawless logic’ that draws from exploitation of others

The colonizer manages the grid of relation by imposing new ways of seeing, divine abandonment of Black existence

What might Fanon’s commitment to self-actualization look like in Machine Learning?

What new ways can we consider collective and individual consciousness as generated within inequitable organizations?

“Particularly as they collide with our visual organizations of the world” (86)

Visual perception

Act of viewing with openness and immersion in opposition with scientific thinking, fails to visualize through lived experience, the body as the site through which one perceives, evaluates, and values the world

Perception an extension of consciousness

Relation between Black body and the world is not in harmony, perception is the site where the Black body is brought into the figure of colonial imagination, Black people cannot equally bring the non-Black other into visible coherence

Disruption in the durability of racial sorting requires a return to sociogeny

Chapter 3, Machine Learning and a Thousand Manifestations of the Ordinary Object

Racialized being in a state of abstraction, between digital and notions of technological progress

Race makes use of machine learning for the purpose of its own survival

Technocrats continue to misjudge the value of racialized life, value of humanity limited to its expression and service of functional utility

ML generally defined, aid in human biological information processing tasks, not to mimic but enhance decision-making

Definitions treat ML as scientific and statistical instead of assemblages of human, technical, social, economic, and political processes

Recurrent language of western discovery, Foucault object of discovery considered desirable based on practical use value

Existence of human difference, and the process by which one claims authority over it, must be considered in machine learning research

Parasitic relationship between techno and social solutionism

Machine Learning = Artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, computer science, statistics

Classification and Regression Tree pioneering statistical work: Brieman, Friedman, Stone, Olshen

Machine learning algorithms do not make assumptions about probability distributions

Classification is an assemblage between general and universally objective attributes and subjective meaning

Two-step process of learning or training, and classification of data, training data consists of ‘tuples,’ derived from previously aggregated data sets

target function, formula an algorithm feeds data to calculate predictions

Paradigms of omnipresent data collection exclude voices of people (who don’t have time, energy, or access to cast votes)

Gaining control over variability a crucial exercise to reduce negative risk factors

Stochastic Pattern Theory, revised approach to pattern recognition, identifies hidden variables

(Pg. 125) “ML has rearticulated how capital and the logics of colonialism move further into the means of discrete efficiency... it’s no coincidence ML is put to use as mediator between capital, the body, and the discrete as the operation of patterning is embedded within its foundation”

Aspiration of future become predetermined as the fragmentation of culture

Chapter 4, Neural Mimicry and Early Learning through Race Play

Machine learning a subfield of the wider discipline of computer science

Various comp sci perspectives, empirical, physics and engineering, tool to deepen understanding with nature, modeling observable phenomena in an embodiment of scientific artifact

Deep learning sub-field, neural networks, Google Brain one of the earliest examples, accumulates/classifies large amounts of unsupervised user data

Human users and consumers a are commercially and computationally valuable via attributes and behaviors exploited for learning and abstracted for classification

Tendency to organize the mundane

AI, two classes of research ‘traditional’ and ‘connectionism’

Connectionism, description of mental phenomenon as a network of interconnected, relational, discrete units

ANN, artificial neural network

Any mental state can be described as a dimensional vector with numeric activation values distributed across a network

‘memory’ generated by modifying relational strength or weight

Sigmoid functions introduce nonlinearity through pattern classification, clustering and function approximation

McCulloh-Pitts behavior of ’nets' as universal

Computation can represent physiological and mental phenomena as operational binaries

Models, differences between statistical modeling and machine learning capture cultural differences in the approach to research

Statisticians interested in capturing variability, uncertainty, confidence intervals, machine learning shares no such confidence or certainty

Model stability informed by relevance in ‘real world’ situations to effect change, model design is sensitive to human programming errors, models must remain temporarily sensitive

Work on assumption past is prologue to the future

Temporality is where preemptive models and profiling models differ

Agents not limited to single persons, objects or entities, can include homogenous or heterogeneous collectives, clusters, or environmental phenomena

Agent-based models, Thomas Schelling 1969, Models of Segregation > suggest thresholds of contentment that justify self-segregation in heterogenous environments

Support vector machines (SVM), learn through association and commonality outside of explicitly history

Data and being in relation to race, are simplified in service of eugenic determinacy

World-making ML algorithms are coded to enact are not limited to race/difference, instead, deeply embedded in production of thought

We have come to trust these positions as authorities over other forms of intelligence, judgement, narrative

Rational discrimination a site of desire, means to express as a site of prototypicality

Chapter 5, Where all things are Bound by Race and Data

17th century Europe, models of human classification, prior to this very few mathematical models to explain the world

Amateurs formalized operations into small ‘life tables,’ data on individual characteristics, age, place of birth, trade

Belief in casual relationships between human social patterns and laws of nature, human life can be approximated > Life tables expanded into subclassifications

Origin of statistics subsumed in administration

Colonial expansion relied on universalization of these processes to optimize resource production

Maximization of capital dependent of endophenotypic sorting of colonized bodies

Leibniz theory of universality, aim to provide governments with tools to estimate population phenomena to serve various interests of the state, quantification of populations

For the state to prosper it needs continual insight on behaviors of human and nonhuman resources

Contemporary practices now assign birth and death rate to national numbers, these data create national profiles, that do not require individuals to be present to be accounted for

Leibniz, early mode of data-driven population governance

If populations can be represented as measurements of state power, similar observations can be made about enemies

Early form of black-box military practice, interesting footnotes about war, compelling the enemy to bend to state will, putting your enemy in a place that’s worse than what you’re asking of them to get your way

German demographer, number of future births could forecast divine will > theory of divine provenance

First tables created on immigration, emigration, nationality, and race in 1745, after publication of The Divine Order, research from German demographer above

Racial classification through the “Great Chain of Being,” strict medieval catalogue with hierarchical structures of all matter and life decreed by God

Reason and imagination like the divine

Divine order justified sorting of lower-ranked humans as natural and mathematically sanctioned, and relinquished accountability of administrators

When the Great Chain of Being lost its power, science picked it up

Poor relegated to lower tier human, meant attempts to aid the poor went against God

Promoting scientific evidence to evolution, eugenicists were able to support racial inequality

Origins with Charles Darwin

Notion of regeneration relied heavily on suppressing undesirable traits, ‘breed out’

Gauss normal distribution curve, representation of spatial distances from normalized average,

simplifies logics of eugenics

concepts of normality produce social and scientific understandings of abnormality to be corrected

Probabilities through sequencing letter counts, distributing tokens into common word lengths in English, 2-gram probabilities, pairs of letters in typical English text, increasing n-grams probabilities

Ali Alkhatib, “Defining AI.” 6 December 2024.

Technical experts declaring a chaperone on collective efforts of activists and organizers trying to understand differences between systems with AI and those without, author analogy to categorizing weapons:

“One might inspect handguns and stun guns, conclude that these are two totally different technologies because they don’t operate on the same technical principles at all, and embarrassingly overlook that they’re obviously both tools police use to maim and kill people. You don’t need to deconstruct a handgun and a stun gun to understand their adjacent, often overlapping, roles in policing.”

Erin: interesting this isn’t the first time I’ve seen a comparison between pathologizing a weapon and pathologizing ai

Technological artifact with political features versus political artifact

Projects that democratize ai conflate with commodification

Defining in this way allows us to thing about unifying experiences we can recognize as AI

Only Persons Intend, Eric Hayot, Pennsylvania State University

LLMs “authorship” and language

No intent, no mind, no responsibility for outputs because of no intent, LLMs do not remember or hold meaning its outputs, it does not have sense or thought regarding the output

LLMs are not social actors, we cannot collapse the meaning of the verb ‘author’ into the meaning of ‘make’ LLMs make language

“Language speaks us... our habits and patterns of mind and thought, our speech and mental life, come into being not via our Romantically individualized free choices, but through systems, discourses, and structures that precede us and determine—if not fully then certainly largely even the sense of self or of personhood that would justify a claim to responsibility.”

Modes of Intelligence, Charles Altieri, Poetics Today, June 2024

AI’s capacity to understand poetry and produce original work? “Arts deploy different models of intelligence responsive to complexities in individual experience”

“Flat regularity of meter, lack of personality for first-person speaker, inability to give a sense of pleasure in the choices the poet makes, failure to distinguish between generalized talk about love or pain and the actual intense experience of a speaker” ...

Lines treated as an accomplishment, so emotion is constantly described instead of enacted

No events, only repeated generalizations, no reaching for self-conscious participation in the work of a creative mind giving purposive shape to the experience rendered

Lacking ability to provide models of careful sympathy or dynamic empathy

In most of these cases, decades old statistical techniques are in use, regression

Diffusion is limited by the speed of human, organizational, and institutional change

Adoption of AI is higher than when personal computation was released, but does not account for measuring specifics of ‘adoption’ or adoption intensity

Electrification and productivity weren’t inherently linked > adoption in factories involved redesigning layouts and factory architecture, considering hiring and training, etc.

The external world puts a speed limit on AI innovation

Ladder of generality in computing, higher runs require less programmer effort

‘Capability-reliability gap,’ major barrier to building useful AI ‘agents’

Parallel learning is limited to privacy concerns and feedback loops in tacit knowledge infrastructures

‘Bitter lesson’ in AI that computational power surpasses human domain knowledge, this is valuable but misinterpreted to encompass application development

Erin- interesting point here in the article, “recommender system on social media are increasingly general machine learning models”

*But manual code is still required for the business logic, frontend, and other components

Erin- I think we’ve discussed this partially, the idea that there’s the computational machine, and then the manual code built by the capitalist voices, humans, within, who tailor and specify to deceive/buy.

The most valuable types of knowledge (social-scientific, scientific) are harder and much slower for AI to access

Benchmarks do not measure real-world utility

The easier a task is to measure via benchmarks, the less likely it is to represent complex contextual work the defines professional practice >

Consistent overestimations of real-world impact, ‘construct validity’

Implementation more about augmentation than substitution, high consequence vs low consequence

Economic are likely to be gradual

Sudden wide automation is implausible, require innovation and diffusion – aligned with AGI definitions

Automation reduces value, focus will shift to tasks not yet automated, tasks that may not exist today, goal post continues to move

Speed limits to progress in AI methods

Ossification of canon, field with more papers make it hard for new ideas to break through

Part II What a World with Advanced AI Might Look Like

Intelligence as capability and power

Human ability is not constrained by biology

Intelligence is not the property at stake measuring AI impact, what is at stake is power, the ability to modify one’s environment

Capability > Power > Loss of control

Games provide misleading intuitions about the possibility of superintelligence

‘Human intelligence is special due to our ability to use tools and subsume other intelligences’

Good at building scoped automated tools for tasks requiring high-speed, while humans remain in control of the system

Forecasting & Persuasion

Unclear that decontextualized capability evaluations have any safety implications, and are misinterpreted as if they do

Control comes in many flavors

Human in the loop control is not synonymous with human oversight of AI, it is one model and an extreme one, may detract benefits of automation

Auditing, pre-deployment and periodic assessments

Monitoring, real-time oversight when system properties diverge from expected behavior

Engineering systems design/control, fail-safe mechanisms, cybersecurity field also rich source of control techniques

Technical AI safety research – judged against the fuzzy unrealistic goal of guaranteeing future ‘superintelligent’ AI will be ‘aligned with human values’

Increasing percentage of human jobs will be related to AI control, hybrid of tasks that require cognitive ability machines are not capable of

Task specification, unambiguously specifying what is desired – a big part of the overall effort

Part III Risks: accidents, arms races (leading to accidents), misuse, misalignment, and non-catastrophic but systemic risks

Market forces will provide an adequate incentive for deployers/developers to take responsibility for mitigating accidents in systems, safety regulation will fill the gaps

Concentration of power is a bigger problem than the possibility of AI accidents

Resilience, Decentralization

Arms races are an old problem

*We explicitly exclude military AI from our analysis, as it involves classified capabilities and unique dynamics that require a deeper analysis

Erin – yikes, military industrial complex can and will be unraveled from these technologies, connectedness between for profit AI companies, and their State war-driven clients.

Companies externalize the costs of poor safety, market failures common in the absence of regulation

Arms races should be addressed in sector-specific regulations

Attribution of failures to product blurry with social media

The primary defenses against misuse must be located downstream of models

For model alignment to work well, it would violate cybersecurity principles, and introduces new attack risks

Strengthen existing vulnerability detection programs instead of restricting AI capabilities as the source

AI is useful for defense

Capabilities in cybersecurity, automated vulnerability detection, threat analysis, attack surface monitoring

Detecting dangerous sequences within open-source software, or biosecurity

Catastrophic misalignment is a speculative risk

Misaligned, acting against the intent of developer or user

Speculative risk, different interpretations of probability, ‘epistemic uncertainty about whether the true risk is zero’

Path to adoption requires demonstrating appropriate behavior in increasingly consequential situations

Deceptive alignment, appearance of alignment with harmful behavior later after power is accrued, risk of superintelligence view

Within ‘normal technology’ view deception is an engineering problem

History suggests normal AI may introduce many kinds of systemic risks

Entrenchment of bias and discrimination, massive job losses, worsening labor conditions, increasing inequality, concentration of power

Erosion of social trust, pollution of the information ecosystem

Decline of the free press, democratic backsliding, mass surveillance, and enabling authoritarianism

These risks arise from people using AI to advance their own interests, with AI as an amplifier for existing instabilities

Decisive and accumulative x-risk

Part IV Policy: center resilience, reject nonproliferation

The challenge of policy making under uncertainty

AI safety coalition well established, scholarship adopting ‘normal technology’ paradigm is gradually taking shape

Interventions to help contain superintelligence could exacerbate risks associated with normal tech by increasing market concentration

Need to prevent the concentration of power and resources, which often means making powerful AI more widely available

Policy makers must adopt value pluralism

Reducing uncertainty as a policy goal

Five types of policy recommendation: whistleblower protection, transparency reporting requirement for deployers, government use inventories, product registration, incident reporting, safe harbor for red teaming of deployed systems

Evidence gathering, guidance on value of types of evidence

The case for resilience: capacity to experience shocks while retaining the same function, structure, feedback, and therefore identity

Strategies:

Societal resilience, protect foundations of democracy

Prerequisites for effective technical defenses and policymaking, funding, transparency requirements, improving ai literacy

Interventions that would help regardless of the future of AI, develop warning systems, incentivizing defenders, legal protections for researchers

Interventions that will help if ai is normal tech, but might make it harder to control a superintelligent ai, competition, open model releases

Nonproliferation is infeasible to enforce and leas to single points of failure

Realizing the benefits of ai

Regulation versus diffusion is a false tradeoff, as is regulation vs innovation, regulation can promote diffusion

Governments should consider funding arts and journalism through taxes on ai companies

Playing with Unicorns: AI Dungeon and Citizen NLP – Minh Hua and Rita Raley

AI Dungeon 2, indie text adventure game with ‘infinite’ customizable adventures generated and narrated by GPT-2

Magical Unicorn Blood

Released by Nick Walton as a Google Colab notebook in 2019, data egress charges reached unsustainable levels, BYU had to shut it down, though the community developed a peer-to-peer hosting solution within hours

1.5 billion parameter language-model-turned game, distributed across AWS

Game cannot completely replicate Newtonian physics, which allows players to experience, and exploit malleable environments

Surreal and absurd

Game is also an application, ‘it has demonstrated a pantological ability to complete software code, top ten lists, and how to tutorials’

Benchmarking text outputs falls short when generated samples are not stable or fully knowable

Training and assessment of a machine learning system by ordinary users (players)

Erin – challenge to understand authors main goals here, but I think it has to do with using a game architecture, situated on top of a neural network, to better understand the nuances of LLMs, by leveraging uniqueness of player experiences

How to Understand Large Language Models

“The Library of Babel” Library (universe) containing books of all possible combinations of 25 orthographic symbols, gibberish of all permutational possibilities

Highest quality gpt-2 samples result from a degree of randomness, rather than maximum likelihood

Critical Code Studies (CCS), computational literacy is empowering

Analysis absent of relations between components and training datasets, absent of systems in the wilds, is only statistical and functional

Understanding of code that is programmed rather than trained, academic study 10 PRINT remains the gold standard, determinism makes in analyzable as text

AID represents a different object of study, constantly variable, meaningful attributes are training practices, user practices, social circulation

General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark (GLUE) - widely adopted collection of 9 data sets designed to assess model’s skills on elementary language operations

Sesame Street transformer models, BERT, ELMo, BigBird, ERNIE, Grover, pretrained on massive text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks

NLG evaluation metrics, limitations in these benchmarks as they may not align with human judgements (but are slow, expensive, and subjective)

Training corpus not univocal, unclear how to best score the model

Erin – considering here discussion around ‘generalization’ vs specificity

What of socio-cultural context? Need for more direct humanistic engagement

Experimenting with GPT-2

“In one hour, in mid-2019, it was possible to retrain a 5GB language model on the cloud to generate any text one chose, with no charge beyond now-baseline compute resources”

Shift to modern open culture of machine learning can be attributed to: Python programming language, Jupyter notebooks, APIs, deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and public release of pre-trained learning models

AI Dungeon as case study

Hodgepodge of statistical model evaluation, media analysis, narratology, and game studies

Colin Milburn’s research on play: “play as a form of engagement, manner of learning, experiencing, and experimenting from the bottom up, when it's no longer possible to imagine sufficient mastery of anything, having fun becomes a significant alternative to having formal expertise”

Revert command allows a process of revision with the user, prioritizes means over outcomes, incremental rather than ends approach to machine learning

‘Remember’ feature for uses to specify bits of information continually fed into GPT-2 at each prediction

Alter command, direct edit of text output, guiding narrative forward

Addition of labeling is the ongoing fetishization of unsupervised learning, free use in exchange for labor and data

Readability, Likeability, Utility – always subjective, required consensus through crowdsourcing

GPT-3 and beyond

Citizen NLP is fundamental to maintaining public purchase on the dizzying pace of the development and deployment of machine learning models

How I Program with LLMs- Ars Technica

Autocomplete, Search, Chat-driven programming (long term need to replace this)

LLMs provide a first draft, fixing the mistakes it may have is a lot easier than starting from scratch on a project

Chat-based LLMs do best with exam style questions

Avoid creating situations with so much complexity and ambiguity, repositories and workspaces too chaotic for models which get distracted

Ask for work that is easy to verify

Ideal task is for an LLM where it needs to use a lot of common libraries, doing a lot of small-scale research for the user

“I foresee a world with far more specialized code, fewer generalized packages, and more readable tests”

Goal is not to be a ‘web IDE’ but to challenge the notion that chat-based programming even belongs in what is traditionally called an IDE

Sketch.dev as a “Go IDE for LLMs,” a space for agents to work without messing the local environment/computer

DCS #23: Dawn of the Coasting AI, Anastasia Salter, John Murray, Lee Skallerup Bessette, Aug 2025

Instructure and Open AI partnership, ai learning experiences within Canvas learning environment, LLM-enabled assignment

Edtech solutionism, dangerous implications for higher education

Human connection versus depersonalized service, hands-on time doesn’t scale whereas AI is all about scale

“Rolling your own site, going back to some old school DH practices is a good way to escape the AI layer and give students the online content they expect”

Building content outside of one model allows it to be available to a wider ecosystem of knowledge vs. Locked in Sam Altman’s world

Important to have multiple models to leverage, to shore up other’s deficiencies

FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) violations and ai > protecting student work and records

How are agentic AI tools useful in digital humanities? How does it differ from edtech?

Interface literacy required involving terminal action, and GitHub

“Distant Coding” vs vibe coding, vibe coding and the danger of individuals owning expertise because of talking to a chat bot

Speeding up processes of work doesn’t lead to understanding, going through the motions is not actually engaging in scholarship

Building a website with GitHub Copilot agents

GitHub education program, different than the agent built in, verification process somewhat tedious, and relies on physical proximity to campus

Working with native technology avoids the constant maintenance required of legacy WordPress sites

Agents on call

Claude agent from GitHub is vs code, creative code with ML5/face mesh

Friction as a feature not a bug when it comes to learning, Martha Burtis

Data analysis with colab and Gemini agents

Narrative Processing

Consumer facing LLMs (Chat GPT, Claude), built-in ai environments, Gemini in Google Colab or Copilot built into VS code, machine learning and LLMs n local environment, with a combination of apps and in-development support

Open AI > Microsoft main partner > ChatGPT, DallE, Whisper

Anthropic > Amazon & Google funded, though independent > Claude

DeepMind > owned by Google, Gemini and Alpha Fold

The Chaos of AI Agents, YT video

Claude and Gemini can read image files on their own and ‘see’ results to then modify, models as their own feedback generators

Indirectly generated images and artwork

Claude for opus, expensive though most powerful model for coding

Glorified autocomplete to generate the next token

Language models as role playing machines, picked up from the training data to pretend to be what the user needs

A country of geniuses in a data center (Claude founder)

Multiagent communication and coordination is exciting but not feasible right now, timing of communication, overwriting and destroying previous agent work

Communicate.txt file for agents to write to one another, read notes from implementations of other models

Fancy word soup, heady ideas, glorious creativity overstated, talking about completing their goals

Agents work best on clear tasks with an end goal, hard to give open-ended creative tasks

Surveillance Capitalism, Platform Capitalism and Data Capture – 9.30.25

The AI Con: How to Fight Big Tech’s Hype and Create the Future We Want, Emily Bender & Alex Hanna

CHAPTER 1: An Introduction to AI Hype

2023, Chuck Schumer AI insight forums, p-doom/hope, inflated sense of self-importance

Detention and arrest on incorrect outputs of automated facial recognition systems, false positives skewed toward Black populations

Deepfake porn, image undressing apps, sexual harassment and bullying, 99% of deepfakes are women, datasets include a lot of porn, nonconsensual images of sex workers bodies, child sexual abuse material

IDF, target selection on Gaza genocide, ‘The Gospel,’ mass assassination factory

Artificial Intelligence is a con, a bill of goods you are being sold to line someone’s pockets

Tropes from sci-fi, appearance of power

AI, marketing trop, technologies sold as such, ‘mathy maths,’ racist pile of linear algebra, stochastic parrots

Automation of: decision making, classification, recommendation, transcription/translation, text and image generation

2010’s deep learning, falling costs of microchips, abundance of digitized data, immense amount of money and capital + hype

Hype, aggrandizement of some person, artifact, or technology/technique that the consumer needs NOW, less you miss out

Drives investment, fear of missing out, promises a life of ease, also depends on promulgating worst-case scenarios

1956 Dartmouth College summer-long workshop around methods of ‘thinking machines,’ developing tools for guidance of administrative, and military systems

Reliance on huge claims, bad citation practices, ‘moving goal posts’ > cold war America sunk its teeth into this

Erin – Precedent of government and state defense contracts, using technologies in areas with anxiety and insecurity (p Doom!) + Weizenbaum and ELIZA, legacy of creation cannot be controlled by a single creator or mind

Murky, unethical funding networks!

Automated systems oversold, people used it and people got hurt, stories that don’t fit this model may have diffuse or undocumented harm

CHAPTER 2: It’s Alive! The Hype of Thinking Machines

“Artificial General Intelligence” meant to differentiate from regular AI, common to indicate thinking, sentient, or conscious machines

n-gram language models, occurrences of text in a corpus, bigram models, calculations to pairs of words, spell-check algorithms, early cell phone texting functions

Computational linguistics, improvements on these basic n-gram language models including ‘neural’ language models

Neural Nets, composites of ‘perceptrons,’ associated with weights, strength of influence, supervised machine learning, for weights to be tuned correctly setup requires large amounts of data with ‘correct’ tags

Co-occurrence, embeddings, information can be pooled across words, pick up patterns in the ways people use language (hateful ways of speaking or socially biased ones)

RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback, exploited workers behind the curtain, traumatic outputs labeling as bad or hateful

Joint attention, ‘intersubjectivity,’ experience of being engaged with someone else’s mind, linguistic systems can be used to understand linguistic artifacts

Distribution of words provides no access to meaning, nothing to deduce communicative intent

AI boosters devalue what it means to be human to argue these systems are humanlike, reduction of human condition to computability

The sharpest and clearest critiques from groups are always excluded from the category of ‘human,’ their expertise is most needed!

Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru highlighting that “AI” systems cannot “see” darker skin

Transgender bodies impossible at airport security, Sasha Costanza-Chock

Identifying general intelligence is racist and ableist to its core

Justifications of racism, measurements of intelligence

Modern day eugenics, combination of conservative politics, obsession with pro-birth policies, and right-wing attack on multiculturalism, hidden behind technological progress

‘negative’ eugenics, certain types of people forced sterilization, ‘positive’ eugenics, promoting the birth of certain people

Developed societies ‘depopulating’ coded language for White countries are not having enough babies, ‘techno-optimism,’ growth + positive eugenics project

Edwards, Benjamin, “Meta’s New AI Image Generator was Trained on 1.1 billion Instagram and Facebook Photos,” Ars Technica December 2023

Imagine with Meta AI, Emu image-synthesis model, 1.1 billion public Instagram and Facebook images to train the model

Quality tuning, traditional models trained using image-text pairs, Emu focuses on ‘aesthetic alignment’ after pre-training using small but ‘visually appealing’ images

Other image-synthesis models include illicit scraped photos from the web, licensed images from commercial stock libraries, or a combo

Containing harmful outputs with filters, watermarking system, and a small disclaimer

Mökander, Jakob, et al. “Auditing Large Language Models: A Three-Layered Approach.” AI and Ethics, vol. 4, no. 4, Nov. 2024

Auditing, governance mechanism to identify and mitigate risks (associated with ai systems), systematic + independent process of obtaining and evaluating evidence

Three ideas, procedural regularity and transparency contribute to good governance

Proactivity in the design of ai systems helps to identify risks and prevent harm before it occurs

Operational independence between auditor and auditee contributes to the objectivity and professionalism of the evaluation

Increasing generalization of models, foundation models, adapted for a plural of actors, pose challenges to assess risks within context of deployment

LLMs a subset of foundation models, NLM natural language processing, most contemporary models use deep neural networks

CLIP, vision-language model, image > text descriptor

DALL-E, text to image model

Three-layered audit approach, governance audit, model audit, application audit

Audits conducted on each level must be combined and coordinated

Responsible development interest, ai labs cohere, OpenAI, and ai21

Scaling law with the training error of LLMs, error falls off as a power of training set size, model size, or both

Ethical risks, discrimination, information hazard, misinformation hazards, malicious use, human-computer interaction harms, automation and environmental harms

Existing audit industries are relevant, IT audits software development and quality management procedures, comp sci verification of model properties, product certification procedures (consumer goods for legal compliance)

Hard to establish normative baseline for LLMs to be audited against

Sandvig et al, auditing algorithms (2014)

Compliance audits compare entity actions to predefined standards/regulations, risk audits ask open-ended questions about how a system works to identify and control risks

Varying level of access for external auditors based on IP protections

Adversarial audits, aims to expose harms, Collaborative audits seek to provide assurance

Need active collaboration between technology providers in auditors

Computer science techniques, red teaming, model fooling, functional testing and template-based stress-testing

Continuous ex-post monitoring

Blueprint for LLM auditing

Who should conduct the audit is outside the scope of this article

“Success of the blueprint relies on responsible actors at each level, who want or are incentivized for good governance” Erin – incentive through what? Incentive is money in these systems, venture capital funding

Governance audits, organizational procedures, incentive structures, management systems, publicize results to prevent companies from covering up outcomes

Review adequacy of organizational governance structures, distinguish accountability from blame

Create an audit trail of LLM development process, design specification, train/testing modes, model cards, system cards

Srnicek, Nick. Platform Capitalism. Introduction, Chapter 3

Sharing economy, gig economy, fourth industrial revolution + entrepreneurial spirit, workers liberated from forever jobs, consumers liberated with on-demand cornucopia of services, promises of networks

Platforms, big data, additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, machine learning, internet of things

(Erin, IoT, networks that can be personalized to communicate technologies to technologies, smart homes, industrial monitoring/fleet management)

Existing commentary,

politics, privacy/state surveillance – lack economic issues around ownership and profitability

Corporations as embodiments of values, critical of lack of humanity, these neglact imperatives of capitalist system

Economic trends unique, disconnected from history

Digital works and smart economy represent shift in relationship between workers & capital, leave aside broader trends, intercapitalist competition

We can learn about major tech companies by taking them as economic actors within a capitalist mode of production.

Seek out profit to fend off competition

NEW markets and commodities

Technology a relatively small part of the economy, manufacturing employs more people, tech companies notoriously small

“Tech Sector” more than defined standards, digital economy refers to businesses that increasingly rely on info tech, data, and the internet for their business models > cuts across many sectors

Digital technology becoming systematically important in similar ways to finance, pervasive infrastructure for the contemporary economy

Idea to legitimize contemporary capitalism more broadly, a hegemonic model, cities are smart, businesses disruptive, workers flexible, governments lean and intelligent

Decline in manufacturing profitability > DATA maintains economic growth

Rise of monopolistic firms

Chapter 3, Great Platform Wars

Overcapacity and overproduction in the manufacturing sector, international competition steadily continued, crisis of overcapacity

Asset-price Keynesianism induced low interest rates to generate higher asset prices and wealth effect to spark broader economic growth > dot-com boom and housing bubble

Network effects tendency toward monopolization, advantages become solidified as permanent positions of industry leadership

Platforms facilitate complementary products, building ecosystems of goods to close of competitors, access to data, network effects, and path dependency place high hurdles to overcome monopolies (like Google)

Need a change in the form of competition

To remain competitive, platforms need to intensify extraction, analysis, and control of data

Expansion of platforms, driven by cross-subsidation of services that draw people to a network, surplus of capital in merger decisions to expand extraction

Consumer IoT a platform-driven extension of data recording into everyday activities,

Calls for privacy miss how suppression of privacy is the heart of the business model

Advances in hardware, database organization, and network infrastructure all play significant roles in advantages over competitors, full stack

Positioning as a gatekeeper, expansion driven by occupation in key positions within the tech ecosystem

Desktop computing > mobile OS platforms, Google licenses Android for free to hardware makers to undercut Apple’s enclosed system, Android has more than 80% of the market

Interfaces and competitiveness, ex: integrating search within apps, natural language tools, bet is that chatbots are the preferred way for users to interact with the internet

Platforms as payment platforms for economic transactions from users

Convergence of markets: tendency of different platform companies to become increasingly similar as they encroach upon the same market and data areas

Major platforms will work strategically together to expand data extraction and position themself in the stack

Enclosure of ecosystems, ex: Meta’s free basics services, manufacturers locked into ecosystems (Siemens or GE)

Non-platform companies are forced to use platforms, intracapitalist competition will divide along these lines

Move from open web > closed apps, expand/close off data collection

Platforms building their own network infrastructures, Microsoft and Meta transatlantic fiber cable

Challenges, overcapacity of manufacturing driving down prices and pushing out other companies, ‘view that the industrial internet’ will turn this around

Seems unlikely, industrial internet drives prices down and increases competition for market share

Asset-price Keynesianism continued, suggests infrequent task services (grocery shopping) will suffer since they don’t generate frequent enough revenue, as well as high-skill personal jobs

Small online tasks likely to remain, draw upon hyper-exploited workers in low-income countries

Money and sabotage remain open for lean platforms

Lean Platforms are reliant on a vast mania of surplus capital, sustained by loose monetary policy and large amounts of capital

Tech boom of the 2010s could just leave premium services for the rich

Advertising revenue does not exempt from crisis, Ad blockers

Transition to direct payment businesses as ad revenue declines, inbuilt tendencies to extract rents by providing services

The state has power to control platforms, antitrust cases to break up monopolies, local regulations to impede or ban, coordinated action on tax avoidance

Public platforms owned and controlled by people

Zuboff, Shoshana. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. Chapter 18 ‘A Coup from Above’

Surveillance capitalism, departs from market capitalism:

Insists on the privilege of unfettered freedom + knowledge

Abandons long-standing organic reciprocities with people

Life in the hive betrays collectivist societal vision sustained by radical indifference and its material expression in Big Other

Freedom and Knowledge

Freedom from constraint, law and regulation, assumptions of markets are unknowable, ignorance requires freedom of action for market actors

Methods of ordering human economic cooperation that exceed limits of knowledge and perception

The market is no longer invisible, compulsion toward totality, supply and demand rendered in infinite detail, mystery > replaced with certainty

Understanding physical and institutional spaces, indexable and searchable, subject to machine reasoning, pattern recognition...

Surveillance capitalists claim the freedom to order knowledge, then leverage knowledge advantage to protect and expand their own freedom

Continuously expanding architecture of Big Other, dispossession of human experience, operationalized

Knowledge and freedom work to accelerate asymmetry of power

After Reciprocity

Rescinds any remaining reciprocities with its societies, no longer reliant on people as consumers, users are sources of raw material, social relations no longer founded on mutual exchange

Small highly educated workforce relative to the massive computational resources

Capital-intensive infrastructure, ‘hyperscale,’ diminish reliance on societies as sources of employees

Reciprocity of consumption contributed to the rise of democracy, outrage ‘at the violation of essential producer-consumer interdependencies’ > American Revolution

Consumer resistance to political oppression, bound to industrial capitalism’s dependency on the masses and their contribution to the prosperity necessitated by the new organization of production

The New Collectivism and Its Masters of Radical Indifference

Surveillance capitalism aims us toward the hive collective, the market (not the state) concentrates knowledge and freedom within its domain

Content is judged by its volume, range, and depth of surplus measured as anonymous equivalence of clicks and likes,

Internal FB memo, the best products don’t win; the one’s everyone uses win, content moderation as a defensive measure vs. Act of public responsibility

Content moderators, secret workforce, janitors, human judgement + machine learning tools, minimum thresholds of user tolerance

Targeting advertising based on hate speech, customers forfeited advertisements based on brand values > click-through rate metrics, ‘auto magic’ of algorithms trained on proprietary behavioral surplus from users

Google and FB learn to weather storms of criticism through

‘Dispossession cycle,’ public apologies, acts of contrition, attempts at mollification, appearances before Congress and Parliament

Erin – would also add here the strategy of a frontman, main brain, who can take all public blame without users ever focusing attention on the company at large

Radial indifference,

doesn’t matter what is in the pipelines, if they are full and flowing,

permanent invitation to the corruption of the first text,

sustain pathological division of learning in society by forfeiting integrity of public knowledge for the sake of volume and scope of the shadow text

What is Surveillance Capitalism?

Antidemocratic social force, lack of accountability to the needs of the people,

Market-driven coup from above, coup de gens an overthrow of people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other

Coup celebrated as personalization, defying and displacing everything personal

Tyranny, obliteration of politics, perversion of egalitarianism, treats all others as equally insignificant

“Irresistible inducements to confluence, shirt saturated with sensors, gentle voice answering queries, TV that hears you, house that knows you, book that reads you, Big Other acts on behalf of unprecedented assembly of commercial operations that must modify behavior as a condition of commercial success” (pg. 21 PDF, 514 in the book)

Information civilization

Instead of dominating nature, dominating human nature

Machines that overcome limits of bodies > Machines that modify behavior in service of market objectives

Cede authority, relax concerns, quiet voices, go with the flow, submit to these technological visionaries, Technological inevitability is the mantra we were trained on, but it’s an existential narcotic prescribed to induce resignation

Surveillance Capitalism & Democracy

Individual experience of insignificance, expendability, political isolation, and loneliness that stoked fires of totalitarian terror

German fascist success attributed to the quest of ‘an effective life’ too overwhelming a burden for people

Cynicism is seductive and can blind us to the enduring fact that democracy remains our only channel for reformation

Be the Friction

Neoliberal evangelism, market freedom and salvation, capitalist Christian values

Capitalism thrives in plasticity, periodically renewing roots in the social, finding new ways to generate wealth in meeting new needs

Not OK to have best instincts for connection, empathy, and information exploited by a draconian quid pro quo that holds goods hostage

Responsibility to rekindle outrage and loss over what is taken from us, human expectation of sovereignty over one’s own life and authorship of one’s own experience

Reject inevitability, Tom Paine, generational assertion of future

Disgust in predicting a continuation of things already happening (Orwell to James Burnham’s Managerial Revolution) instinct to bow down before a conqueror

Break the spell of enthrallment, helplessness, resignation, numbing

Surveillance capitalism reminds us that shared trust is the only real protection from uncertainty, up to us to use our knowledge, regain our bearings!

In the quest of nature, industrial capitalism’s victims were mute, those who would try to conquer human nature will find victims full of voice

Toolkit: Critical Race Studies – 10.7.25

On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? Bender, Emily (2021)

Increasing size of LMs by number of parameters and size of training data, environmental impact scales with model size, as does difficulty understanding training data

Recommendation to ‘budget for curation and documentation; at the start of a project, only creating datasets as large as can be sufficiently documented

LM, string prediction tasks, likelihood of a token

Before neural models, n-gram models, pretrained representations of the distribution of words, word embeddings

Transformer models benefit from larger architectures

Reducing model size though distillation, quantization, factorized embedding parameterization, cross-layer parameter sharing, progressive module replacing

Environmental and Financial Cost

Recommendation to report training time and sensitivity to hyperparameters on model release, and urge governments to invest in compute clouds for equitable research access

Green AI, sustainable computing, green chemistry, use efficiency as an evaluation metric

Computing power has increases 300,000x in 6 years, far higher pace than Moore’s Law

Harms fall on marginalized groups, environmental racism

Unfathomable Training Data

Size doesn’t guarantee diversity, many factors narrow internet participation, overrepresenting younger users and developed countries

Reddit data scraping (67% of users are men in the US and between 18-29), moderation makes platforms less welcoming to marginalized populations

Unmeasured and unknown content is filtered out,

‘cleaning’ by discarding pages with obscene words: effective at removing pornography, but may remove words like twink, in online spaces for queer people

Social movements influence reframing of minority narratives, these movements may be poorly documented or receive skewed media attention, shifting frames that train LMs

Phrases referencing disabilities more negative sentiment, gun violence, homelessness, drug addiction overrepresented in texts discussing mental illness

How to measure toxicity generated by LMs? Toxicity classifiers would need culturally appropriate training data for each context of audit

Undocumented training data perpetuates harm without recourse

Down the Garden Path

General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, SQuAD, SWAG

Languages are systems of signs, pairings of form and meaning, LMs are only form, they do not have access to meaning in training datar

Stochastic Parrots

Coherence in the eye of the beholder, from our ability to recognize interlocutor’s beliefs and intentions within context

Human language takes place between individuals who share common ground and are mutual aware of that sharing

Even when we don’t know the person speaking, we build a partial model of who they are and what common ground we think we share

Comprehension of meaning is an illusion from the singular human understanding of language

Risk and Harms

Risks from absorbing hegemonic worldview, propagating or proliferating overtly abusive views and associations, amplifying abusive language that may be included in the next iteration of large-scale training data collection

Bad actors taking advantage of LMs ‘coherent’ texts on specific topics (ex: conspiracy theories, extremist recruitment)

Ruha Benjamin, “Feeding AI systems on the world’s beauty, ugliness, and cruelty, but expecting it to reflect only the beauty is fantasy”

Pre-mortem analysis, center hypothetical failures and challenge team members to engineer previously unanticipated causes

Value sensitive design, conceptual investigations should come before researchers become deeply committed to their ideas

Relation-Oriented AI: Why Indigenous Protocols Matter for the Digital Humanities, Brown Michelle

AI systems as a constellation of technologies aimed at replicating key components of human intelligence, language use, reasoning, agency

Growth in robotics, internet of things, 3D printing, nanotechnology, genome editing, quantum computing, advance biology

Blurring lines of physical, biological, digital realms

Nation states, corporation, public and private organizations publishing ranges of declarations and manifestos on machine ethics

Indigenous communities and approaches are being left out of these declarations and construction

Protocols vary across indigenous groups, at the core humans do not sit at the center of creation, kinship of animals and plants, wind and rock, mountain and ocean

Standards of behavior used to show respect to one another, a way of conducting business, also to knowledge procedures, how it’s used, recorded, disseminated

Indigenous protocol and AI workshops (IP-AI, in 2019)

Open a dialogue to the multiplicity of indigenous knowledge systems and technological practices

Hardware and software sovereignty, how to build anything ethically, language landscape and culture, art practice as value practice, AI as Skabe (Helper)

IP-AI Guidelines

Locality, grounded in local and global

Relationality and Reciprocity, systems should understand how humans and nonhumans are related + codependent, systems are part of a circle of relationships where they are, and their status depends on specific communities

Responsibility, Relevance, and Accountability, to your community

Develop Governance guidelines from Indigenous Protocols

Recognize the cultural nature of all computational technology, computation is a cultural material

Respect and support data sovereignty, fundamental review of ‘ownership’ and ‘property,’ the product of non-indigenous legal orders

Technology Futures built with traditional practices

370 million indigenous peoples living in over 90 countries worldwide

We need to embrace these voices! Recognize they are powerful and interconnected

Reject techno-utilitarianism, this will create relationships akin to the enslaver and enslaved

AI Colonialism, Karen Hao, MIT Technology Review, 2022

AI repeating patterns of colonial history, violent capture of land, extraction of resources, exploitation of people, enriching wealthy at expense of the poor

The Costs of Connection, foundational text of data colonialism

Barcelona, Catalan modernism, iconic aesthetic, architectural movement of the rich

AI has new ways of exploitation, often in the Global South, populations that ‘are less deserving’ of livable wages and economic stability

South Africa’s Private Surveillance machine is fueling a digital apartheid

Local security industry, forged under pressure of high crime, embraced surveillance tech > rapid creation of centralize, coordinated, privatized mass surveillance, Vumacam

CCTV cameras, Vumacam Proof 360 software platform uses AI to highlight footage with security alerts, ‘unusual’ activity

Subscription based model, rent access to desired clusters of camera feeds

South Africa has just over 1,100 police stations and 180,000 staff, there are 11,000 registered security companies, with 564,000+ actively employed security guards, more than the police and military combined

Remnant of apartheid, police controlling unrest in gov opposition, political interest, duties took precedent over actual police work for the public

Martial Private Security Sector, serve paying clients, not the public interest, monitoring affluent suburbs, expansion of fiber connection allows camera + internet connectivity

Vumacam, pushing a new level of centralization and coordination

Users can add wanted vehicles, reported stolen or used to commit a crime, boasts speed in this approach, faster than filing a crime report

Opening the platform for third-party developers to add their own applications for users

Company switching model to flat fee for full network access, allows Vumacam to place cameras irrespective of paying customers in vicinity

Absent from conversation is why crime exists in the first place

Inequality drives crime, white people have the means to pay for surveillance

Digital equivalent of passbooks, internal passports, apartheid-era system to limit Black people’s movement in White enclaves

Privatization of public safety crowds the discussion for allocation of wealth, improved access to water, sanitation, education, utility!

South Africa becomes a testing ground for surveillance techniques and AI adoption within these systems

Risk of state collusion with probate companies, as the state has no capacity to run a complex network

How the AI Industry Profits from Catastrophe

Data-labeling services, demand for broad base of cheap labor to manually tag videos, ghost work, Venezuela a primary source of this labor

Educated workers joining crowd working platforms for survival during economic catastrophe, huge power imbalances

Mixture of poverty and good infrastructure makes this possible

Self-driving cars pushed data annotation needs to new level, frames are manually tagged for cars to learn to ‘see’

MTurk fell out of favor for specialized work, general results not accurate enough

Scale AI, founded in 2016 by a 19-year-old student at MIT

Provides services to US department of defense, worker facing platform ‘Remotasks’ to build a global pool of cheap contractors

Worker pay tied to speed and accuracy, sought contractors in the Philippines and Kenya, then targeted Venezuela, specific landing page with invitation-only and appearance of bonuses and increased earnings

Image tagging, content moderation, product categorization, or impossible tasks broken requests

Appen, adjusts pay per task to the minimum wage of each worker’s locale, after Spare5 shuttered and the pandemic hit, tasks dwindled

Hive Micro easiest service to join, offers the most disturbing work! Terrorist labeling

Workers tuned to Remo Plus, a few months in the platform capped earnings, meanwhile Scale continued misleading advertising with attractive testimonials and images of money

Worker communication through trainers, community managers, recruiters who were often contractors for the company

Workers use discord to try and organize and share tips as it relates to weathering inconsistency with work, sharing tasks links to claim, avoiding specific client IDs that can cause account suspension

Unreliable payment, $10 minimum payout, power outages mid task erasing work and earnings, scale reduces pay

Firms source workers from impoverished and marginalized populations, low-income youth, refugees, people with disabilities

The Gig Workers Fighting Back Against the Algorithms

Gojek, Indonesia’s largest ride-hailing firm, a growing movement of resistance against dispatch algorithms dominating life

Base camps, informal gathering and resting places for workers ‘on-bid’ waiting to accept ride requests

Algorithmic management pits workers against one another, scatters them across a vast geographical area, weakens worker’s ability to connect in person and build rapport

Jakarta’s drivers could reveal a new playbook for resistance, building collective power

Informal motorcycle taxi economy in response to gridlocked traffic of traditional commuting

Ojeks, motorcycle riders, Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim, turning informal transformation into an orderly, semiformal industry

Early gains offered for these workers, though lost agency, obedience to the platform’s policies and algorithms > price wars and driver competition

Workers have no option but to keep working, technology an instrument for labor exploitation, algorithm penalizes illness, demotes status of account

Tips and concerns from drivers about scammers shared through social media or loose networks of WhatsApp and Telegram groups

Solidarity of driver groups, broad community support as well, relationships between drivers and the neighborhood, makeshift shelters, food stalls

Everyday resistance, tactics to help drivers and regain control

‘Paid therapy services’ to retrain your account’s algorithm and assigned jobs, taking over one’s phone and coaxing the account in the right ways

Tech-savvy communities have developed ecosystems of unauthorized apps to help drivers fine-tune their accounts, illusion of a driver who is resting, still working to help avoid penalties

Tuyul apps, a mythological creature that steals money on behalf of its owner

Driver networks grow and accumulate political capital, sought to agitate for broader reforms, social media to protest undesirable app updates

Parking fees now passed to customers at select locations

Fighting for legal protections and recognitions of motorbike drivers and taxi associations

“Asosiasi Driver Online”, regulatory changes

A New Vision of Artificial Intelligence for the People

New Zealand, Te Hiku Media, nonprofit radio station bought an ai machine to train their own algorithms for NLP

revitalize Māori language while keeping control of community data

Radical departure from the industry standard

Only the most common languages have enough speakers, and profit potential for Big Tech to collect data to support them

Te reo banned in assimilation laws from English colonizer, urbanization also broke community centers weaking language preservation

Māori community fought to reverse trend, language act in 1987, three years later creation of iwi, tribal radio stations to increase accessibility

Gold standard for preservation, learning through daily exposure as a child

Language encodes culture, evolves through those who speak it and inhabit its meaning

Michael Running Wolf, Indigenous technologist

Data sovereignty, lates resistance against colonizers, the nation-state, and big tech companies

Beginner and intermediate speakers able to transcribe and read better than listen to recordings, solution:

Had participants record themselves reading a series of sentences, from the pairs of spoken and written sentences it would learn te reo syllables in audio

Competition to drive submissions! Community mobilized

310 hours of speech-text pairs, 200,000 recordings, 2,500 people > bootstrap with an existing open-source model

“If they want te reo to be ubiquitous... speaking assistants ... they’ll need to partner with big tech” Erin – Not everything needs to be ubiquitous! Less ubiquitousness!

Ed Tech, AI, and the University – 10.21.25

Academia: Dispatches From the AI Front, Timothy Burke (2025)

Columns to answer back to voices in academia thinking uncritically or naively embracing AI

Using generative ai to write a paper that simulates attention from a student who has been seemingly present and accounted for in discussion, is unsettling

Erasure in real time

Course instructions describe writing as a form of witnessing, a transcription of experience in the course, emphasize experience and process

A Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights Education, Kathryn Conrad (2024)

Truth to media’s obsessive focus on plagiarism or violations of academic integrity, teachers across ages have managed thus technology-driven turbulence with little support

Techno-determinists portray teachers as pearl-clutching technophobes

Pressure to ‘teach with’ generative ai is gaining, especially because education is perceived as a lucrative market

Designers did not consult with educators, at times models emerge from technocrats that actively oppose higher education and imagine it to be automatable and the acquisition of monetizable skills

Biden administration office of science and technology policy, 2022, blueprint for an ai bill of rights

Safe and effective systems, algorithmic discrimination protections, data privacy, notice and explanation, human alternatives, consideration and fallback

These principals as starting point, supplemental set of rights from the author

Rights for Educators

Input on purchasing and implementation, input on policies

professional development support/training for critical ai literacy, autonomy: educators should not be pressured to adopt or penalized for opting out

Protection of legal rights

Rights for Students

Guidance, when/how generative systems are being used

Consulting instructors and administration without fear of reprisal

Privacy and creative control, appeal misconduct if falsely accused, notice when an instructor or institution is using automated systems to process assignments and evaluate

Protection of legal rights

Kirschenbaum, Matthew, and Rita Raley. “AI and the University as a Service.” (2024)

Metanarratives, modular, preprogrammed by software (templates in Word or PowerPoint), propagated through public discourse, promoted search rankings, optimization and algorithmic amplification on social media feeds

“Regarded as customizable feature sets rather than ML applications,” sensational release of new models, conjuring visions of profit and limitless growth

Educational institutions leading instigators of the media cycles to which institutions strain to respond, white papers, task forces, ad hoc committees, executive consultants

Output of reports, visualizations, slide decks, can now be machine generated

AI implementation commonplace especially in telecommunications

Incapacity of educational institutions to respond to the sociotechnical situation, response other than denial, prohibition, capitalization and capitulation

Education should be prepared to think about structural changes in language practices

Language and literature subject to external forces

“Prompting a model,” a specific activity and an abstraction

Means more than typing words into a text-entry window, prompt engineering

ChatGPT, referential and self-referential all at once, appeal of an interface with a basic messaging window and familiar menu options

Subword tokenization, parts of words that bear no necessary relation to the linguistic units identified and categorized by human sciences (ex: “th”)

2024 MLA convention

Generative AI, prison literature, medical humanities

Recent theories and methodologies singled out in past attention are increasingly regarded as ordinary, within disciplines they serve

Agility demanded of the moment results in a deferral of agency and responsibility, task forces develop responses within a bounded and belated repertoire

Critique > Historicism, Political Economy, and Materialism

Engagement > Pedagogy and Practice, no stable or singular path forward

Data Work > Origins and Archives, the New Data Philology

Framing privatization of creative work in conservative terms of authorship and IP, necessitates a concession to market economy for culture

Cultivate and support alternative data resources, public data hubs for the language model ecosystem

Experimentation > New Methods, Embodied forms of knowledge

Critical making, DIY culture, hacker manifestos, creative avant-garde, open-source activism

Build small, bespoke datasets

Evaluation > aesthetics and critical judgement, practical criticism

Benchmarks now work well enough; all remains is application, which is to say monetization and personalization, this is the time for intervention

How can we qualitatively evaluate model output?

Professional-Managerial Work > New Templated Forms for Teaching and Research

Implementation will be predetermined, even if some is salutary and intellectually rewarding, all will be inseparable from the political, economic, and institutional circumstance of the university in ruins

Blackbox AI, promotional campaign demonstrates emergence of a template that speaks to productivity schema, across the full spectrum of knowledge economy

Language is a managerial apparatus

Tokenization of language promises to render universities vulnerable to market logics

University as a service, UaaS (idea from software as a service)

Licensing and subscription agreements favor short-term budget planning, enable a vision of scalable, customizable, cost effective, on demand university

“If it is true the future belongs to crowds ... it will be the cultures of personality that accrete around billionaires, politicians, billionaire-politicians, celebrities, and other influencers, all targeted/manipulated by the outrage of merchants who command the largest and most lethal followings on social media”

What to do with the remains of the day?

What comes after even the ruins have been repossessed and enclosed?

On the Limits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education, Neil Selwyn (2024)

Critical issues and concerns around educational implementation of ai

limited ways for practices to be statistically modeled,

risk of social harm for minoritized students,

losses incurred through reorganization to ‘machine readable’

Ecological and environmental costs

AI and education, some basic points of definition

Gov beginning to adopt automated education governance, using ai to process big datasets from school systems to model ‘business decisions;

Automated grading, proctoring systems, chat bots, surveillance of diligent work

‘Narrow artificial intelligence’ designed to address one specific task, far removed from speculative forms featured in popular discussions

Need to foreground ‘actually existing ai’ and its limitations alongside IT firms and the flows of funding promoting it

Brittle quality of machines, mistakes and incorrect reasoning, statistically derived ‘brittleness’

Key idea that the social work can be reduced and modeled in abstract form, represented, ordered, and rendered calculable (engineering mindset)

Educational ai dependent on training data relating to education, students’ uses, classroom sensors or pre-existing context data generated offline

Dependence on proxy variables, extractable data to substitute for direct measures

Problems of representation and reduction

Strong argument that basic aspects of teaching and learning cannot be captured reliably in data form, even more true for complexities of a student’s social circumstances

Technologically smart, socially stupid in real life

AI cannot predict how a child’s life will turn out even with a ton of data

The Social harms of AI

Algorithmic discrimination, automated grading systems, false judgements of voice recognition ‘cheating’ for non-native accents

‘Quality of service harms,’ systems fail to perform consistently, not recognizing faces of color, neurodiverse students eye gaze patterns

Fitting education around the needs of AI

Reverse adaptation, people prove willing to adapt their social worlds to technologies (rather than expecting tech to adapt to the social world)

‘Adapting to the algorithm’ adjusting behavior to be machine readable, ‘parse-able pedagogies,’ easily codified ways of teaching with outcomes easy to input

AI as environmental burden

AI is reliant on a chain of extractive processes, resource-intensive, depletion of scarce minerals and metals, energy and water for processing/storage, and toxic waste pollution

Educationalists would do well to be open to that all forms of ai tech are intrinsically incompatible with a habitable earth

AI and education, some ways forward

Avoid getting mired of hype! Easy to get wrapped in sudden ‘common-sense’ arguments that incursion is inevitable, teachers need to upskill, traditional education needs to be reconsidered

Educators need to take control and work to proactively shape agendas

Education should play a key role in collective counterbalance to hyperbole of recent debates

Move away from portraying ai in education as a technical object, and instead as a system bound with messy realities

Discuss alternate forms of ai to better fir education, a way it could be genuinely useful, objecting rhetoric and expansionist practice of ai as a solution for everything

Seybold, Matt. “Against Technofeudal Education.” Substack newsletter. The American Vandal

Leah Belsky, VP of Education at Open AI, most EdTech enterprises owned by venture capital and private equity who want to gigify education, surveil students, and mine data

Coursera, decentering advanced learning, upskilling and reskilling to anybody

Escalating ‘arms race’ of ai produce, free trials, public-private partnerships, global hype tours

Technofeudal class sees US education as the most important sector for takeover with immediate returns

AI as a tool for submission, subservience, and asceticism in the name of national supremacy, cultural hegemony, and economic isolation

White House executive order task force to roll out AI education in K-12 public schools

Schools a reliable stream of subscription fees, and repositories of ‘aggregatable ‘and monetizable data

Edtech startups fantasize about transforming themselves into candidates for the ‘magnificent seven’ companies whose reliable dominance is sustained by their manipulation of entire economic sectors and consumer bases

Techno-feudalists! Control of proprietary information and networking structure

Threats to further disenfranchise students already dealt lockdowns, learning loss, book bans school shootings, protest suppression ...

Dependency and addiction for an entire generation, mass adoption

Measures for reducing complicity

Print is a rent strike, technofeudalism sustained by rents paid in the currency of attention and identity (data)

“Onlinification” of education, Annie McClanahan, has students and instructors ‘paying rent,’ substitution of paper tests is a strike against this

Books included in tuition, in the meantime consider using discretionary funds to subsidize

“Ungrading,” certification, assessment, accreditation popularized by admin and politicians to justify rising tuition from Reaganomic defunding of schools

Technofeudal vision overestimates motivational power of grades, grade vigilance drives edtech marketing around finals weeks

Promote acquisition of skills over acquisition of certification!

Luddification of classroom spaces, classrooms as safe spaces and free speech zones – this cannot happen when big brother is listening

Peers and transcription software, not wanting recording of ‘stupid questions’

Potential to remind students of their capabilities without tech

Demobilization of computing infrastructure

Direct tech budgets toward desktops and computer lab technology, desktops will increase student familiarity with the most powerful and versatile computing applications

Computer labs as community-building spaces

Faculty Governance & SaaS subscriptions

Academic workers slow to recognize the threat they pose, edtech subscriptions often made without faculty governance

Be most vigilant with SaaS, cloud-based software paid for on a fee schedule, these providers have access to data from the entire school’s user base

Environment and AI - 10.28.25

Kate Crawford, Atlas of AI, Chapter 1, “Earth”

Silver Peak, in Nevada’s Clayton Valley, an abandoned mining town from the gold rush, area perched on a massive underground lake of Lithium

Mining commonly overlooked in strategic amnesia of technological progress

Commerce follows the flag, but the flag follows the pick – only profitable since it’s not accountable for true costs of environmental damage, illness and death of miners, and community displacement

Extraction, no value placed on the existing resources as is, San Francisco grew from mining money in the gold rush, skyscrapers inverted minescapes

Lithium crystal, ‘gray gold’

Landscapes of Computation, Rockwood Holdings Inc, the only operating Lithium mine in the US

Mass-market batteries, limited lifespan, once degraded must be discarded, Tesla Gigafactory is the world’s largest lithium battery plant, Tesla is the number one consumer

Purchasing high volumes of batteries from Panasonic and Samsung

Half of planet’s total consumption, a battery business

Essential for laptops, mobile devices, backup power, they undergird the internet

Full-stack supply chain of AI reaches into capital, labor and Earth’s resources, A Geology of Media Jussi Parikka, media as extension of Earth

Elements required for these systems formed over billions of years alongside earth

e-waste dumping grounds in Ghana and Pakistan

Large scale consumption of energy keeps the cycle going

The Mineralogical Layer

Lithium mines in Salar in southwest Bolivia, central Congo, Mongolia, Indonesia, Western Australia deserts

US Geological survey with a short-list of 23 critical minerals that are a ‘high supply risk,’ unavailable and entire industries halt

Local and geopolitical violence with extraction, mining operations also finance military operations, and working conditions amount to modern slavery

Intel and Apple criticized for auditing only smelters, not actual mines, to state conflict free status of minerals, certifications now under question

End-product manufacturers assert provenance is impossible to source, a measure of plausible deniability, ignorance of supply chain baked into capitalism

Black Lakes and White Latex

Baotou, Inner Mongolia, lake of toxic black mud, waste powder from ore processing, runoff from Bayan Obo mines, contains 70% of world’s rare earth minerals

China supplies 95%, market domination from willingness of extraction damage, acid dissolving creates reservoirs of poison

Ratio of usable minerals to waste toxins is extreme, and 99% of mined earth is removed as waste ‘tailings;

Bangka and Belitung Indonesian islands with tin production, unregulated, scarred island

Transatlantic telegraph cables > internet cables, Latex trees in Malaysia used for electrical insulation for undersea cables

Global submarine telegraphy business grew, workers paid little for slow dangerous work, processed and sold through Singapore trade markets

Early colonial networks between centers and peripheries

Jungles of Malaysia and Singapore stripped to near extinction

The Myth of Clean Tech

2019 UMass Amherst research around carbon footprint of NLPs, 660,000 pounds of emissions (five gas cars over their whole lifetime), this does not include true scale of commercial ops

Data centers compute power increasing

Corporations buy indulgences out of environmental guilt (offset credits)

AI platforms licenses to energy infrastructure to help them further extract

Consequences of extraction go beyond what the nation-state was designed to address

Water, NSA data center in Utah, city of Bluffdale made a multi-year deal with the city

Cargo container, relatively cheap mode of navigation, sea blindness to shipping industry, most companies use low grade fuel in enormous quantities

AI as megamachine, Lewis Mumford 1960s concept, systems consist of work of human actors

McMenamin, Lex. “ChatGPT Is Everywhere — Why Aren’t We Talking About Its Environmental Costs?” Teen Vogue, 7 May 2025

Teen Vogue, readers coming to the site through ChatGPT with sustainability inquiries

Data centers sapping the grid, high computing power is resulting in questionable choices by these companies, reinvesting in nuclear

Reappropriates resources that could be used for basic need

Climate conditions make these infrastructures more vulnerable, and water consumption/greenhouse gas emissions impacted at large scale

“mid” technology, ai perfect for the ‘post-fact era,’ harvesting and removing information from context, lacking ability to analyze with nuance

The real value is doing the reading yourself

Erin- where are the opportunities really? To struggle through something with time and energy, this keeps coming up in the university realm and in meaningful acquisition of knowledge, we’re short attention wired regardless of ai, these models are taking advantage of it

Adding “-AI” will remove automated summaries, or switch to another search engine

Hogan, Mél. “The Fumes of AI.” Critical AI, vol. 2, no. 1, Apr. 2024. Silverchair

Missing from ai conversations, how we can be living at a time of such computational promise and be in dire conditions for humans and nonhumans getting exponentially worse

Myth of progress defined by technological exploits

Integration into existing mining and fuel industries, foreclosing alternatives

Reliance on millions of low paid workers networked through data center industrial complex

Deepest need of ai in the present era is fuel for its own expansion, fuel industries leveraging ai to extract more

The political underpinnings that drive notions of progress through extractivist technologies is largely a project of understated white supremacist Big Tech totalitarianism.

Dawson, Ashely. “The Costs of the Cloud.” New York Review of Books. 27 September 2025. (PDF)

Pour demand increases, 2024 predicts twice as much power in 2028, surging demand has a range of sources, spread of electric vehicles, electrification of buildings and industry, and energy hungry power centers for ai

Microsoft & Constellations Energy

Amazon & Maryland company X-Energy, small modular reactors

Trump administration supportive of Nuclear, concerns that plans follow previous models that failed and caused major shutdowns, slow to construct and expensive

Deregulating processes in the nuclear regulatory commission

Danger of catastrophic system failure

Efforts of greenwashing or slowing of renewable energy mean ai will turn to fossil fuels even more

Dramatic overbuild of infrastructure, forecasts show 90% of global chip market, companies put in requests to build more projects than they tend to complete, knowing they won’t be approved

US energy consumption remained relatively flat from 2005 – 2017

This occurred despite growth of cloud-based online services like Facebook and Netflix, and the growth of Crypto currency

Projections of this energy use is sophisticated guesswork, serves of chips and processors and training of models is an energy-intensive process

Prompting the model requires different amount of energy, mostly since it’s repeated many times (as in, self-driving cars repeatedly prompting the model

Queries vary in consumption based on model, time of day, length

Generating images uses less energy that generating text from an LLM, making a video uses much more

Big Tech use closed-source ai, code it not available to the public and they don’t release impact information

Google release a report on energy use with Gemini, though not revealed how many prompts are processed every day, still impossible to calculate footprint

Autonomous agents could be used as a luxury expense service

Concentrated wealth from these technologies in the US and Asia

Global South countries stand to be the worst impacted by AI uptake

Typical control proposals from the left: anti-trust legal measures, ‘fair capitalism’

Human rights measures for ‘ethical ai’

Organize to boycott software and platforms by these companies and opt for free programs, “People’s Tech”

Producing hardware requires significant concentration of technical knowledge and capital, but that should not dissuade us from working to socialize supply chains, digital intelligence, and data (Kwet, Digital Degrowth)

AI can be made more efficient if data centers were required to be more flexible when they consume power, being aware of regional power grids during peal stress

Flexible training schedule to use energy at optimum moments: none of these reforms will happen without government regulation!

Companies should be made to pay for expansions in infrastructure to produce the increase in electricity they need

Adding utility-scale solar and wind power to the grid is cheaper and faster than nuclear attempts

Utility companies have clear financial incentive to offer tech firms discounted rates and raise rates elsewhere to make up the difference

Based on the idea that public benefits from new infrastructures, so states almost always approve, and costs are passed on to consumers

Communities in the south starting to fight back

O’Donnell, James and Crownhart, Casey. “We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.” MIT Technology Review, 20 May 2025

Question of how much a single query costs is vital to understanding bigger consumption picture

Our ai footprint today is likely the smallest it will ever be

AI models loaded onto clusters of servers with special chips, Nvidia H100

University of Michigan research on energy demands, ML Energy leaderboard

More parameters generally mean better answers, but more energy required

Model size is a predicter of demand,

Code Carbon tool to test energy required for video generation, 109,000 joules, then a new model released required 700x more energy, running a microwave for over an hour

Caveat to all math that the numbers can’t serve as a proxy for something like chatGPT

Ability to understand emissions and energy demands are hampered by the fact that AI is not yet treated as its own sector

Screenshots of the exchange

Dongmei Cheng, Mimi Li , and Tony Lee. “Leveraging ChatGPT for research writing: An exploration of ESL graduate students’ practices.”

Study highlights how ‘advanced ESL’ writers can adapt GenAI tools to their unique writing processes, while preserving individual agency

Comprehensive tutorial based on Warschauer et. al’s 2023 ai literacy framework

Tools can potentially serve as equalizer in linguistic disparities

Concerns that tools might reduce ‘writing from complex cognitive process to mere text-generation and post-editing'

Fostering ai literacy requires technical skills and reflective practices to empower writers to negotiate their multilingual identities and resist AI’s potential to homogenize academic discourse

Unique challenges at graduate student writing level

Genre awareness, rhetorical knowledge, language proficiency

AI may prove a good tool to analyze and dissect genre analysis based on examples of writing sections (ex: literature review, citation section)

Important that LLMs are complimentary tools to language instruction

How do grad students engage with ChatGPT during research writing? How is the output incorporated into papers? What are grad students’ perceptions of using the tool for their writing?

Prompts used by two grad student participants organized into Excel sheets

Theme identified: content, clarity, coherence, documentation, genre, language use

Thematic analysis further divided into subcategories, consecutive prompts in the same category noted as one occurrence

Text analysis of papers compared to chat histories, percentages of adoption across categories and overall adoption rates calculated

Inquiring in the content category a critical support, aided in various stages of writing

Clarity category frequently overlapped with others

ChatGPT to summarize content from websites, rephrasing output to avoid direct adoption, both students wary of over-reliance

Appreciation of reducing burden of ‘silly questions’ perceived judgement from instructor

Student educational backgrounds led to different uses across themes

Rather than prescribing specific levels of ai use, educators can guide students in developing their own informed approaches that complement existing writing processes to preserve authorial voice

Zhaozhe Wang and Chaoran Wang. ” A Posthumanist approach to AI literacy.” Computers and Composition 76 (2025)

Scholars from literacy studies, applied linguistics, and writing studies are recontextualizing theories and methodologies from digital literacy, multiliteracy, multimodal writing, and digital rhetoric

Widely perceived as alien, alienating force, fundamentally altering habitual ways

Algorithmic entity, not sentient

Autonomous android <> “just a tool,” rigid paradigm assuming human-non-human binary, both extremes limit opportunities

Posthumanism focuses on relationality between human agents, non-human actants, and co-production of agency through human machine intra-actions

“Material agency more expressive”

Case study: multilingual undergraduate students using ai in a writing classroom

AI Literacy: having the essential abilities that people need to live, learn, and work in our digital world though AI-driven technologies

Framework considers positionality, and interactions vs. ‘using and applying’ in earlier work

Few have stopped to question institutionalize obsession with authorship and textual ownership

Sustained production/consumption cycle defining the individual (Erin – knowledge economy capital, owning ideas)

Recognition of individual writer production of meaning, meaning as always human created and imposes on an otherwise meaningless material world

AI exposes distributed nature of agency in writing

Literacy has evolved alongside technological innovation

Adaptive process shaped by human-nonhuman assemblages (Erin – we feel this multiple times in one lifetime based on how quickly things move, home-phone to mobile)

Agency is tangled! Actor Network Theory, relational effects of network interactions

Assemblage and Rhizomaticity, spontaneous, emergent, ongoing process of arranging heterogenous elements

The Rhizome has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle, assemblages form around agentic moves of any actants

Language is the site where meaning, power, and agency coalesce

We can no longer pretend practices of literacy float free from machines

Relational work rather than transactional work, question capitalist discourse of anthropomorphism

Case Study of two multilingual students

Environment selection and structuring practices, strategic management of these practices

How do undergraduate writers manage digital environments?

Attention economy, reliance on tools designed to lead attention astray

Some suggest cultural backlash against distractive technologies is an oversimplification

21st century composition studies, usefully drawn on new materialism to explore the ways writing is embodied, writers are more than their brains! Bodies, spaces, tools play a role in attention and composition

Interruptions create an environment where all content blends, intentionally locate writing in public spaces of similar work, to create a momentary stability

Mindfulness habits conducive to persistence

Positioning this article alongside need for ‘not-writing,’ and writing as embodied

Horizontal Attention Ecosystem, algorithms but also design and interfaces of and between digital devices,

Narratives to overcome self-restriction, self-discipline, struggle as a matter of personal responsibility and willpower – these reports mirror ‘distraction and addiction narrative’ tropes studies have sought to debunk

Distraction and overwhelm is a collective problem

Study at Elon University first-year writing class, participants for surveys and focus groups, process provided microcosm of writing situations students navigate

Interviews transcribed and coded along three axes: Horizontal attention ecosystem, strategic digital ESSPs, and Embodied writing activities

Multiple tabs, messaging apps, platforms, competitively vying for attention

Regardless of strategic device use, students experienced equality of importance for all digital stimuli and choices

None equated self-discipline with technological abstinence, instead trying to restrict devices delivering irrelevant information to the situation

Restriction a common strategy as well as isolation, a lot of failure and guilt at succumbing to temptation, counterproductive and unfair

Body unconsciously reacts to stimuli; restriction can have negative impact as bodies experience decreased arousal at switching between content reinforcing preference

Orient technology by manipulating time, making it thick and dense with interaction

Drift logic, movements in online space leading to wander outside intended places

Emphasis on writer as lone being

Distraction is not a monolith; they vary in degree and kind and offer different writing and learning experiences, recognize impacts on composing efforts

Kumar, Harsh, et. al. “Human Creativity in the Age of LLMs: Randomized Experiments on Divergent and Convergent Thinking.” (Feb 2025)

Unclear how co-creation with LLMs will impact human creativity unassisted, two core components of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking

Standard LLM vs coach-like LLM with guidance, control group no assistance

LLM may provide short term bursts of creativity, but hinder independent creative performance when users work without assistance

Introduction, what does AI hold for human creativity?

Creativity inherently subjective, difficult to measure, prior knowledge, experience, environmental context, all interplay

Divergent thinking, generation of multiple unique ideas, fostering exploration and innovation

Utilized Alternative Uses Test (AUT) - participants asked to come up with creative uses for common objects

Convergent thinking, refining ideas to select the most effective solutions

Remote Associates Test (RAT) - finding a word that connects three given words

Study across groups shows

LLM assistance boosts performance during assisted tasks but hinders unassisted

User skepticism toward divergent tasks, beneficial effects in convergent

Persistent homogenization effects from LLM strategies, challenging to design effective LLM coaching systems

Related work

Theories from Poincaré and Boden

Four phases model of creativity as unconscious and active, divergent thinking in preparation and incubation, convergent in insight and revision

Boden, measures of creativity, psychological and historical, ideas novel to the individual vs ideas novel to the historical content of human knowledge

LLMs can be utilized to guide users through conceptual spaces of creative thinking

Generative AI use impacting how culture is created and propagated

Homogenization of output, reduction of diversity in expression

Hofman et al, sports metaphor: steroids and AI as short-term gain and long-term detriment, sneakers symbolize ai tools that augment skills without consequence, coach symbolizes ai as a guide to individuals own capabilities

Experiment 1: Divergent Thinking

Effects of LLMs that directly provide ideas or guide participants with a framework to come up with ideas, exposure phase with LLM and solo phase on their own

Items for the AUT, tire, pants, shoe, table, bottle

Dimensions measured: originality, fluency (how many ideas), individual-level diversity of idea set, creative flexibility, group-level diversity of ideas

Erin – hard time interpreting the graphs and results produced here, raises questions about measuring interactions with LLMs and their impact, and the mathematical reduction of measuring creative variables

Experiment 2: Convergent Thinking

Using RAT, participants presented with three words and asked to generate a fourth, widespread use in prior research and compatibility with LLMs

Exposure and solo phases as with the first experiment

This test has a singular correct answer, able to define a metric for convergent thinking skills as accuracy on these problems

Erin – questioning this paper that aims at testing creative thinking, ‘testing’ vs ‘experiential,’ the metric they employ seem to go along with the (same prevailing) idea we can compute level of something subjective (creativity)

Control group, LLM answer, LLM guidance, completing additional rounds of testing after the ‘intervention round’

Participants created a survey assessing: Self-reported creativity, attitude toward ai use in daily life, perceived test round difficulty, perceived helpfulness of exposure rounds

Test rounds felt more difficult when the participant had completed tasks with guidance

Key Findings and Discussion

LLMs boost performance during exposure, but unassisted participants excel in test

Preference toward ai use for convergent thinking, consistent with structured, goal-oriented, ‘correct solution’

Persistent homogenization of ideas and the challenges of designing LLM coaches

Participants in the study with no LLM interactions generated the most diverse idea sets

Limitations

Future work for real-world creative activities, ‘more natural like writing advertisements, designing magic tricks, solving complex problems’

Testing creative tasks that are non-verbal or visual

Short exposure periods of study, limited ability to fully understand

Kritzer, Naomi. “Cat Pictures Please.” Clarkesworld Magazine, January 2015

The Library of Babel, Jorge Luis Borges (1941)

Shape of the Library

“The idealists argue that hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.”

Books containing past languages, future languages

“For a long time, it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible”

Imperfect Facsimiles, works differing only in a letter or a comma

Belief in the presence of a book that includes the formula or a guide to all the rest

Myth and belief in a higher order

Depression state of everything having been written

The human species will be extinguished but the library will endure

Infinite belief, or limited though so vast set of permutations

Funes the Memorious, Jorge Luis Borges

Immobilty the price to pay for perception and memory infallible

Infinite vocabulary for natural series of numbers, usable mental catalogue of all the images of memory

Pursuit of perfection in cartography can lead to a disconnect between reality and representation

Baudrillard, Jean “The Precession of Simulacra” pp 1-12; “The Orders of Simulacra” pp 92-102, 120-121; 146-147, 151-152

Abstraction today no longer the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept

Hyperreal, the map precedes the territory

Product of an irradiating synthesis of combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere

Age of simulation begins by liquidating references

Systems of signs mean more than meaning, binary oppositions, combinatory algebra

The real is produced from miniaturized units, matrices, memory banks and command models, nothing more than operational

The Divine irreverence of images

Iconoclasts, rage to destroy images as they sensed the omnipotence of simulacra, there has never been any God, only simulacrum

Iconoclasts accorded images of their worth, modern and adventurous minds

What if God himself can be simulated, reduced to the signs which attest his existence?

Uninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference

Successive phases of the image: reflection of basic reality > masks and perverts' basic reality > masks the absence of basic reality > bears no relation to any reality

Transition from signs which dissimulate, to signs which dissimulate nothing

Strategy of the real, neo-real, and hyperreal whose universal double is a strategy of deterrence

The Automation of the Robot (pg. 92 – 102)

Two artificial beings, theatrical counterfeit, the robot the worker

Notes

Interactive Data Visualization

DATA 73200, Profesor Ellie Frymire, ellie.frymire@gmail.com

The Power of Representation, Norman Donald

Power in devising external aids to enhance cognitive abilities, things make us smart

Paper, pencil, reading and writing as the most important external aids

Education through apprenticeships in more traditional communities

Socrates, reflection and thought over experiential (books, writings)

Middle Ages readers taught rhetoric to employ while reading, mnemonics, allegory, typology, mental elaboration in the mind

Cognitive Artifacts

Keeping track of complex events, abstraction

Representational systems have two parts: the represented world, the representing world (a set of symbols standing in)

Representations of representations allow higher-order relationship thinking, ability to find these structures at the heart of reasoning

Experiential artifacts allow us to experience events as if we’re there

Telescopes, movies, recordings, instruments like a gas gage, mediations between the mind and the world

Reflective Artifacts allows us to ignore the real world and concentrate on artificial worlds, danger to food representation and reality

Things left out are mostly things we don’t know how to represent

Matching the Representation to the Task

Game of 15, computation required, tic-tac-toe, perceptual answer

For computer arithmetic representation is much easier

Differing, complementary powers of human and information processing

No single format is correct for all tasks

How Representations Aid Information Access and Computation

Find relevant information, compute desired conclusion

Pill organizing failures, medication dosages, understanding timing overlaps very difficult for many

Roman numeral computation vs modern day Arabic numerals, vs tally mark

Additive and Substitutive Representations, density, saturation, brightness proper fit, colors without intuitive scales require more work for the viewer

Naturalness and Experiential Cognition

Experiential cognition is aided when the properties of the representation match the properties of the thing being represented

Perceptual principle, perceptual and spatial representations are more natural

Graphs often superior to tables

People are only aware of their conscious experiences, a mere fraction of what goes on in actual psychological reasoning

Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analysis: A Taxonomy of Tools that Support the Fluent and Flexible use of Visualizations, Jeffrey Heer & Ben Shneiderman

Visual analysis progresses in iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement, taxonomy of interactive dynamics:

Lecture 9.15.25

Database of comments, Erin hadn’t considered this, adding this type of feature and interactivity to a page and the storage requirement of interactivity

View manipulation, coordinated views, iteration on visuals

Dashboard vomit, email language requests for understanding from data colleagues, do people interact with these?

Visual encodings, grammar of graphics

The Grammar of Graphics, Introduction, Leland Wilkinson

Grammar, rules for art and science, within language a formal system of rules for generating lawful statements, makes language expressive and expands scope

Mathematics and aesthetics, sensory attributes to abstractions

Bertin’s Semiology of Graphics, 1967

Graphics versus Charts, shunning chart typology, lack of deep structure, theory of graphics not charts

Object Oriented Design

Strategies to make software flexible and reusable, objects basic components of systems, factory, decorator, facade, proxy, iterator, observer, visitor

Objects communicate through messages, objects relatively stupid, intelligence resides in the system, not in objects, whole is more than sum of its parts

Reusable, and function is encapsulated, other objects don’t know how they work, objects are modular, can inherit attributes from other objects

Objects polymorphous, OOD induces designers to abstract, systems are hierarchical

OOD is not a language or graphical user interface

Graph a set of points, graphic a physical representation of a graph, three stages of graphic creation, specification, assembly, display

Specification, translation of user actions into formal language, statistical graphic specifications:

Data, set of data operations that create variables from datasets

Trans, variable transformations

Scale, scale transformations

Coord, coordinate system

Element, graphs and their aesthetic attributes

Guide, one or more guides

Assembly, coordinating geometry, layout and aesthetics to render accurately, do not confuse surface features with deep structures

Display, (ex: paper, video, hologram), brushing, drill-down, zooming, linking

Resilient Web Design, Chapters 1 – 4, Jeremy Keith

Chapter 1, Foundations

Technologies aren’t created in isolation, imprinted with ghosts of their past, sexagesimal way of counting from the Sumerian civilization

Precision experiments at CERN, nuclear research in Europe, Large Hadron Collider, particle accelerator, theorists and experimentalists, blackboards vs computers

ENQUIRE, software to manage information, Information Management: A Proposal, vague but exciting > the world wide web!

CERN byproduct! Tim Berners-Lee

Telegraph and undersea cables > pulses of light traveling through fiber-optic cables

The internet has no center! Engineers held ideals in free speech, concerned with censorship not nuclear attack

Hyperspace, HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, identified with a URL, “A” element, anchor, HREF attribute allows casting off to URLs, hypertext

Ted Nelson, Vannevar Bush, As We May Think (1945)

SGML, standard generalized markup language

HTML tags, interoperability

Chapter 2, Materials

Browsers encountering unknown tags will ignore them and display content within, visual instructions for many elements, less about meaning

Expression in danger of visual features, Håkon Wium Lie, Cascading Style Sheets

Loose error-handling allows growth

HTML hacks for designers, treating html as a tool for appearance instead of description, needed designers to use CSS but it had an initial lack of browser support

Microsoft Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator

CSS Zen Garden, Dave Shea, showcase of varied web design through CSS

In tightly coupled systems, each piece is dependent, this is at the price of resilience, failure could take the whole system with it

Architecture, material honesty, one material should not be used as a substitute for another, otherwise there’s deception

Chapter 3, Visions

Ratio of the browser window, unfixed, early web days had designers create fixed-width layouts for pages, paper-like approach to designing

Consensual hallucination of an inflexible web

Built in biases of photoshop and Dreamweaver (early web building tool)

Rise of mobile devices and flexible layout, ‘the mobile web’

Shared illusion of one-size-fits-all approach began to evaporate

Responsive web design, embrace the idea of One Web

Fluid grids, percentages instead of pixels

Flexible images, browsers adept at resizing images, need not be a limiting factor

Media queries, CSS defined styles and dimensions

Content-out way of thinking, fundamentally different than the canvas approach based on page design, a materially honest discipline

Chapter 4, Languages

ARPANET precursor to the internet, datagrams, packet switching, lax approach to errors

Declarative languages, desired outcome described without step-by-step instructions

Imperative languages, most programming languages, must provide precise instructions, power and precision, at the price of a high learning curve

JavaScript! The one choice for imperative code in a web browser, Brendan Eich

Popular enough it migrates to a declarative language over time, easier to write and more robust

JavaScript used by advertisers to spawn multiple browser windows, pop-ups and pop-under became so intolerable browsers developed ways to block

Web 2.0, Web app, Appiness

JavaScript must be available and reliable, Ajax

Downloaded in entirety before contents parsed

Web as a platform, No! The Web is a cross-platform, the whole point is user connectivity, the web is not a platform, it’s a continuum.

A Layered Grammar of Graphics, Hadley Wickham

Transformations, responsibility of scales, plotting a graph, identity transformation, graphical objects combined from data, scales and coordinate system, and plot annotations

Faceting, general case of conditioning, trellising, latticing, produces small multiples

Statistical transformations, summarizing data (ex: mean, median, mode)

Stat can add new variables to the original dataset

Dataset as input, returns dataset as output

Components of a plot, default dataset and mappings, one or more layers, one scale for each aesthetic mapping used, a coordinate system, facet specification

Data independent from components of the plot, graphics can be applied to several data sets

Data turns abstract graphics into concrete graphics

Geometric objects, geoms, control the type of plot (line vs point etc.)

Collision modifiers, tweaking geometric elements as not to obscure one another

Scale guides, axes and legends

Annotation guides, highlight important data points

Readily detected problems: too many variables, overplotting, alphabetical ordering, polar coordinates
