Please don't try and summarize these as I know you can't accurately read them, I'm mentioning just for context of their places. My notes are as follows, which includes a bulleted list of broad interesting class themes from my notes at the top and then followed by a small structure of how discussion could go. I need to create a set of text to post to the class website that will be my discussion questions etc. \"Critical AI Studies - 11.11.25 Class Discussion Questions\n\nThemes from previous class notes (journal) \nComputational irreducibility, processes cannot be reduced \nHow would you investigate something that takes lifetimes to look up?\nStatistical notions of what\u2019s interesting are homogenizing \nThe ability to make claims and declare them truth\nWhat is meaning-making versus intent? And what is at stake in these definitions? How do they show up in the world? \nRejection of our inner worlds, rejection of authorship and intentionality \nCognitive offload, convenience, \u2018microwave dinner,\u2019 attention economy \nCompression of time\nNon-human agency?\nAI as companion technology, what do we do with it?\nChat-user interface is a wrapper the LLM operates in, conversation structure \nAttack on language, voice, tone, authorship\nWhite english training and colonial voice\nSmaller, specific, community models, invest money in public alternatives\nLiteracy \nMateriality, Extraction, care, land stewardship\nInvisible Labor, invisible costs, most vulnerable communities suffer\nData centers straining communities, fragile existing power grid, gargantuan water consumption \nTechnoutopian hype cycles\nCan we use and trust tools at all? Binary critical response to engagement.\nConfusing and potentially harmful lack of student use policies\n\n\n\nTheme: Art, Creativity and AI \n11.11.25\n\nErin initial broad ideas:\nNovelty vs. Patterning \u2192 Authorship of ideas and meaning \nOpening discussion Library of Babel, Refik Anadol? Two considerations examples? \n\nSet an agenda of discussion to move through these themes by each reading: \nHistory of fakes, creation of non-existent material\nRe-use artwork, parody, transformation, sampling, photoshop\nIP and institution of protected works, who does this function for? \n\nReading 1: DAZED article, James Bridle \u201cInside the Infinite Imagination of a Computer\u201d \n\nQuote, \u201cDelayed revelation that images are always false, artificial snapshots of moments that have never existed as singularities, forced from the multidimensional flow of time itself. Unreliable documents; composites of camera and attention. They are artefacts not of the world and of experience but of the recording process \u2013 which, as a false mechanism, can never approach reality itself\u201d \n\nAny Walter Benjamin context here? \nGood time to raise discussions of false materials, non-existent, concerns of fakes, reference to earlier class with image guessing game\n\nHarmful underbelly of these tools with deep fakes\u2026\nAlso serious implications for artists who traverse ownership and individual protection of work\n\nReading 2: New Yorker, Kyle Chayka \u201cIs AI Art Stealing from Artists\u201d\n\t\n\tAI slop creative materials, music, artwork, \n\tCompanies shortcutting, \u2018saving money\u2019 by using ai-generated content \n\n\tImage generation tools: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DreamUp\n\n\tErin - instagram posts or images of ai is poop from a butt?\nDefenders of AI art and Transformative use examples of artwork, lichtenstein? Pop art movement\n\nReading 3: \u201cResearch Study Human Creativity in the Age of LLMs\u201d \n\n\u2018Creativity\u2019 in a broad sense and AI\u2019s impact on this process (as discussed in the writing week) \nGeneralization of convergent and divergent thinking, question about this? \n\n\n\n\nReading 4: Supposed to be about libraries, archives, museums - professor hasn't provided this text yet so don't include anything here\"",

To use the command line:# see which files have changes associated with them\n$ git status\n\n# add, or 'stage', files or folders for this commit\n$ git add [path/fileName]\n# you can also do the shorthand git add . to add all files\n\n# commit the files with a brief explanation of what you are changing\n# ex: `git commit -m 'add bar chart legend`\n$ git commit -m 'message regaring what changes you are commiting' When you are ready to push up your code to your remote repository, you can run: $ git push That's it!

Add this anywhere in your `index.md`:\n\n```markdown\n### JS Input Example\n```\n\n```js\n// Create a simple input element\nconst input = document.createElement(\"input\");\ninput.placeholder = \"Type your name here...\";\n\nconst output = document.createElement(\"p\");\noutput.textContent = \"Hello, visitor!\";\n\ninput.addEventListener(\"input\", () => {\n  output.textContent = `Hello, ${input.value || \"visitor\"}!`;\n});\n\n// Append elements to the page\ndocument.body.appendChild(input);\ndocument.body.appendChild(output);\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2\ufe0f\u20e3 How it works**\n\n1. **Create input box**\n```js\nconst input = document.createElement(\"input\");\n```\n2. **Create a paragraph to display output**\n```js\nconst output = document.createElement(\"p\");\n```\n3. **Add an event listener**\n```js\ninput.addEventListener(\"input\", () => {\n  output.textContent = `Hello, ${input.value || \"visitor\"}!`;\n});\n```\n- Whenever you type something in the input box, the text in the paragraph updates automatically.\n\n4. **Add them to the page**\n```js\ndocument.body.appendChild(input);\ndocument.body.appendChild(output);\n```\n- This actually renders them in your browser.\n\n---\n\n### **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Save and preview**\n- Save the file (`Cmd + S`).  \n- Go to your local server (`http://127.0.0.1:3001/`).  \n- You should now see a text box and a paragraph that updates as you type.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Optional improvements**\n- You can add CSS styles inline if you want:\n```js\ninput.style.margin = \"10px\";\ninput.style.padding = \"5px\";\noutput.style.fontWeight = \"bold\";\n```\n- This makes it look nicer without touching a separate CSS file.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can **write a ready-to-paste full snippet for Lab 0** that includes:  \n\n- Markdown headers  \n- HTML table, list, and image  \n- JS input element  \n\n\u2014 so you can just copy it into `index.md` and see everything working.  \n\nDo you want me to do that?",

You want something that feels more *anchored in your own intellectual voice*, with the depth and theoretical texture of your draft, but shaped into a cohesive piece that reads like a discussion leader\u2019s post \u2014 something your classmates can actually move through and respond to.\n\nHere\u2019s a text version that maintains your tone and framework (opening thoughts \u2192 theoretical grounding \u2192 readings with considerations and questions).

Everything is in plain text so you can post it directly.\n\n---\n\n## Critical AI Studies  \n### Week of 11.11.25 \u2014 Art, Creativity, and AI  \n**Discussion Leader: Erin Livingston**\n\n---\n\n### **Erin\u2019s Opening Thoughts**\n\nThis semester, we\u2019ve created a foundation of knowledge around AI systems and their infrastructures as reductions. These probabilistic networks of statistical homogeneity are not artificial and not intelligent. \n\nAs Kate Crawford describes, there are two pillars of mythology at work in contemporary AI discourse:\n\n1. **That non-human systems can be an analogue for human minds.**  \n   This belief erases the relational fabric that connects humans with ecologies, histories, and environments.  \n2. **That intelligence exists independently.**  \n   This obscures the powerful social, historical, and political forces that give meaning to the very concept of \u201cintelligence.\u201d\n\nI think these two pieces offer a compelling framework for discussing artwork and creativity within AI systems. For one, Crawford\u2019s critique reminds us that \u201ccreativity\u201d as framed by AI companies or image generators often detaches from its ecological, embodied, and communal roots. I\u2019m especially interested in the second piece, which speaks to our recent discussions of *meaning-making* as situated within human\u2013machine entanglements.  \n\nEric Hayot helped ground us in this earlier in the semester when he wrote:  \n> \u201cLanguage speaks us... our habits and patterns of mind and thought, our speech and mental life, come into being not via our Romantically individualized free choices, but through systems, discourses, and structures that precede us and determine\u2014if not fully then certainly largely\u2014even the sense of self or of personhood that would justify a claim to responsibility.\u201d\n\nIf we apply Hayot\u2019s thinking to AI art and language models, we might ask:  \n**When systems generate text or images through pattern recognition, are they mirroring the way language \u201cspeaks us,\u201d or are they flattening it\u2014removing the social and historical depth that gives meaning to language in the first place?**\n\n---\n\n### **Novelty vs. Patterning \u2014 Authorship, Ideas, and Meaning**\n\nOne of the core tensions this week is the difference between *novelty* and *patterning*\u2014the question of whether creativity is about producing something new or about recombining what already exists.\n\nThe quasi-emperors of our technofeudal empires believe fully in the capability of patterning to compose novelty. At its core, this logic insists that the universe can be calculated, extracted, and controlled; that the forces of mathematics and computation can build complete representations of reality.  \n\nBut the arts have always held different models of intelligence\u2014ones that value subjectivity, ambiguity, and the unquantifiable. Creativity in this sense is relational and situated; it resists total capture by pattern.\n\nThe *Library of Babel* is an apt parable here. In Borges\u2019 story, the library contains every possible combination of letters, meaning every book that ever could exist already exists. The result is not knowledge, but chaos. The library overwhelms meaning, leaving its inhabitants searching endlessly for significance in the noise. This metaphor mirrors AI\u2019s data-saturated patterning\u2014everything is there, yet meaning requires *embodied interpretation*.  \n\nSimilarly, artists like Refik Anadol use data as material, transforming massive datasets into immersive visual forms. His work often raises the question: **Does scale and computation produce imagination, or only simulate it?**  \n\n**Discussion Questions:**  \n- **Can novelty emerge from pure pattern recognition?**  \n- **If AI models are built to compress and predict, what happens to surprise, intuition, or risk\u2014the core qualities of creative thought?**  \n- **In what ways might the human act of interpretation still matter most, even when AI systems generate the form?**\n\n---\n\n## **Readings and Discussion Considerations**\n\n---\n\n### **Reading 1: James Bridle, \u201cInside the Infinite Imagination of a Computer\u201d (DAZED)**  \nBridle\u2019s piece invites us to question not only whether AI-generated images are \u201creal,\u201d but whether any image ever has been. The work challenges the idea of photography or digital imagery as documentary truth, suggesting instead that all images are *fabrications*\u2014artifacts of attention, mediation, and technology.\n\n> \u201cDelayed revelation that images are always false, artificial snapshots of moments that have never existed as singularities, forced from the multidimensional flow of time itself... They are artefacts not of the world and of experience but of the recording process\u2014which, as a false mechanism, can never approach reality itself.\u201d\n\nThis reading connects to broader class discussions about the politics of representation and the \u201charmful underbelly\u201d of visual AI technologies\u2014from the aesthetic fascination with generated imagery to the violence of deepfakes.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**  \n- **If all images are \u201cfalse,\u201d what makes AI-generated ones feel more threatening or uncanny?**  \n- **How might Bridle\u2019s framing challenge our desire for authenticity or \u201ctruth\u201d in art?**  \n- **Given that 99% of deepfakes target women and often use non-consensual or exploitative materials, what does this reveal about who is most vulnerable in the production of \u201csynthetic creativity\u201d?**  \n- **Is there a line between fascination with the new and complicity in harm when we engage with these images?**\n\n---\n\n### **Reading 2: Kyle Chayka, \u201cIs AI Art Stealing from Artists?\u201d (New Yorker)**  \nThis article focuses on questions of authorship, appropriation, and the political economy of creativity. It asks us to consider whether the use of existing artwork in AI training datasets constitutes *theft*, *transformation*, or something else entirely.\n\nChayka situates AI art within a lineage of remix, sampling, and parody\u2014from collage to pop art to digital meme culture. Yet, as we\u2019ve discussed, AI systems lack context and intention; they do not *situate* their meaning. They pull from everywhere and belong nowhere.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**  \n- **When does influence become exploitation? How do we distinguish between inspiration and extraction?**  \n- **If artists like Lichtenstein or Warhol recontextualized found images, what makes AI\u2019s re-use of data feel different?**  \n- **What does it mean to say AI \u201csteals\u201d from artists when it operates at the scale of millions of images and voices?**  \n- **Would using an AI tool *within* a creative platform (like Photoshop or music software) change the ethics of its use? Does context matter?**  \n- **Who benefits most from the current structure of \u201ccreative\u201d AI\u2014individual users, corporate entities, or the system itself?**\n\n---\n\n### **Reading 3: \u201cHuman Creativity in the Age of LLMs\u201d (Research Study)**  \nThis study offers an empirical perspective, exploring how large language models might influence human creativity\u2014particularly through the lenses of *divergent* (idea generation) and *convergent* (problem-solving) thinking.\n\nThe framework raises interesting questions: if AI excels at convergent tasks\u2014making connections, summarizing, optimizing\u2014what happens to the more open-ended, uncertain processes that define divergent creativity? Do these tools amplify or constrain human imagination?\n\n**Discussion Questions:**  \n- **Does the distinction between divergent and convergent thinking help us better understand how AI systems shape creativity?**  \n- **How might human-AI collaboration reinforce or erode our own creative capacities over time?**  \n- **Can we imagine a productive or ethical partnership between human imagination and machine patterning\u2014or are they fundamentally at odds?**\n\n---\n\n### **Closing Consideration**\nAcross these readings, we might return to a central question:  \n**What forms of creativity do we want to preserve, protect, or reimagine in the age of generative systems?**  \n\nIf AI is a companion technology\u2014as we\u2019ve said before\u2014then how do we engage it without surrendering authorship, meaning, or care?\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to add a short \u201csuggested discussion flow\u201d paragraph at the end (e.g., how you might open and transition between readings in class)? It could make this version double as your speaking outline.",

How does this reshape our sense of authorship, agency, and adaptability in creative work?\n\n**Option 2 \u2014 Process-oriented:**  \n> The study notes how AI systems can accelerate or scaffold parts of the creative process \u2014 but what are the implications when these tools are withdrawn or break down? What does this reveal about our growing dependence on machine collaborators?\n\n**Option 3 \u2014 Framed as a \u201cwhat if\u201d thought experiment:**  \n> If a generative AI tool you rely on suddenly became unavailable, what parts of your creative practice could persist \u2014 and which might be lost? What does that reveal about the balance between human and machine creativity?\n\n**Option 4 \u2014 Comparative / analytical:**  \n> How do the authors address the risks of creative over-reliance on AI tools, and what does this suggest about the sustainability of human creativity when technological infrastructures are unstable or withdrawn?\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you phrase one of these so it matches the tone and style of your other discussion questions \u2014 e.g., the short, open-ended structure you used in Reading 2 (\u201cWhen does influence become exploitation?\u201d).

Let\u2019s walk through this step-by-step so you can clone your class repository successfully.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Step 1: Open Terminal\nSince you\u2019re on **macOS Sonoma**, do this:\n- Open **Spotlight Search** (press `Command + Space`)\n- Type `Terminal` and hit **Enter**  \nYou should now see a command prompt like:\n```\nErin@YourMac ~ %\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc2 Step 2: Navigate to the folder where you want your class files\nYour teacher suggests `Documents/Repositories`, so let\u2019s create and go there.\n\nIn Terminal, type:\n```bash\ncd ~/Documents\nmkdir Repositories\ncd Repositories\n```\n\nThis means:\n- `cd ~/Documents` \u2192 change directory to your Documents folder  \n- `mkdir Repositories` \u2192 make a new folder called Repositories  \n- `cd Repositories` \u2192 move into that new folder  \n\nYou can check you\u2019re in the right place with:\n```bash\npwd\n```\nYou should see something like:\n```\n/Users/Erin/Documents/Repositories\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f Step 3: Clone your **fork** of the repo\nNow go to **GitHub in your browser**:\n1. Open your fork of the class repository (it will look like `https://github.com/yourusername/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025`).\n2. Click the **green \u201cCode\u201d** button.\n3. Copy the **HTTPS link** (it should look like this):  \n   `https://github.com/yourusername/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025.git`\n\nThen in your Terminal, paste it after `git clone`:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025.git\n```\n\nHit **Enter**, and Git will download the repository into your folder.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddc2 Step 4: Move into the project folder\nOnce it\u2019s done cloning, go inside the folder:\n```bash\ncd Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025\n```\n\nYou can check that you\u2019re inside by typing:\n```bash\nls\n```\nYou should see files like `README.md`, maybe a `package.json`, and other project files.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Step 5: Install dependencies\nIf your teacher mentioned dependencies, it usually means the project uses **Node.js**.  \nTo check if Node is installed, run:\n```bash\nnode -v\n```\nIf it shows a version (like `v20.10.0`), you\u2019re good!  \nThen install dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\nThis reads the project\u2019s `package.json` and downloads everything needed.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have Node installed, I can walk you through that next \u2014 it\u2019s a quick install.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to tell me the **GitHub link** to your forked repo, and I\u2019ll double-check the exact command for you?  \nOr would you like help checking whether Node.js is already installed before running `npm install`?",

You\u2019ll just need to tell Terminal to go into your **Desktop/RepositoriesEL** folder before cloning.  \n\nHere\u2019s exactly what to do \ud83d\udc47  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Step 1: Open Terminal\nPress `Command + Space`, type **Terminal**, and press **Enter**.  \nYou\u2019ll see a prompt like:\n```\nErin@YourMac ~ %\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc2 Step 2: Navigate to your Desktop folder\nType:\n```bash\ncd ~/Desktop/RepositoriesEL\n```\n\n\u2705 That command means:  \n- `~` = your user home directory (like `/Users/Erin`)  \n- `Desktop/RepositoriesEL` = the folder on your desktop where you want the project saved  \n\nYou can confirm you\u2019re in the right place with:\n```bash\npwd\n```\nIt should say something like:\n```\n/Users/Erin/Desktop/RepositoriesEL\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f Step 3: Clone your fork from GitHub\nNow go to your **forked** GitHub repository (the one under *your* username).  \nClick the **green \u201cCode\u201d** button \u2192 make sure \u201cHTTPS\u201d is selected \u2192 copy the link that looks like:\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/yourusername/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025.git\n```\n\nThen paste it after `git clone` in your Terminal:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025.git\n```\n\nPress **Enter** \u2014 you\u2019ll see it start downloading.  \nWhen it finishes, you\u2019ll have a new folder called `Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025` inside `RepositoriesEL`.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddc2 Step 4: Move into the cloned folder\n```bash\ncd Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2025\n```\n\nCheck what\u2019s inside:\n```bash\nls\n```\n\nYou should see project files (like `README.md`, `package.json`, maybe some `src` folders, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Step 5: Install dependencies\nIf the project uses Node.js, run:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf you get an error saying `npm: command not found`, that just means Node.js isn\u2019t installed yet \u2014 I can walk you through that setup in one minute.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to check if you already have Node installed before running `npm install`?  \n(You can test by typing `node -v` in Terminal.)",
